## Error: Push Rejected (fetch first)

**Error Message:**
```
! [rejected] main -> main (fetch first)
```
**Cause:**  
Your local `main` branch is behind the remote `main` branch. Someone else has pushed changes, and you need to incorporate their work before pushing yours.

---

## Step-by-Step Fix

1. **Pull the latest changes:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main
   ```
   - Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository.
   - If there are no conflicts, the merge is automatic.
   - If there are conflicts, Git will prompt you to resolve them.

2. **Resolve Conflicts (if any):**
   - Open conflicted files. Git marks conflicts with `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, and `>>>>>>>`.
   - Edit the files to keep the desired changes.
   - Stage the resolved files:
     ```bash
     git add <filename>
     ```
   - Complete the merge:
     ```bash
     git commit
     ```

3. **Push your changes:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   - Your local branch is now up-to-date and can be pushed.

## Error: Refusing to Merge Unrelated Histories

**Error Message:**
```
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```
**Cause:**  
Your local repository and the remote repository do not share a common commit ancestor. This often happens if you initialized a new local repo and try to pull from a remote that already has commits.

---

## How to Fix Unrelated Histories

1. **Pull with the `--allow-unrelated-histories` flag:**
   ```bash
   git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
   ```
   - This tells Git you intend to merge two independent histories.

2. **Resolve any merge conflicts:**
   - Edit conflicted files as described above.
   - Stage and commit the merge:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit
     ```

3. **Push the merged history:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

**Why this happens:**  
Git prevents accidental merges between unrelated repositories. Using the flag confirms you want to merge them intentionally.

## Summary of Commands

```bash
# Pull latest changes and merge
git pull origin main

# If you see "refusing to merge unrelated histories"
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories

# Resolve conflicts, then:
git add .
git commit

# Push your changes
git push -u origin main
```
