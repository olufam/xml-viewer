	<overview>
		<ovdesc>
			<p>This is the table in which the COB or Service in tenant system can be controled from the Master - in a Multi-Tenant architecture.</p>
			<p>On authorisation of a record in this table (with OPERATION.MODE set to EXECUTE) one or more events are generated. These are xml based and are sent using the Integration Framework infrastructure. From the IF.EVENTS.INTERFACE.TABLE these event based messages can be taken by (or sent to) external tools (such as an ESB) which can then transform and route them to the respective tenant(s).</p>

			<field>TSA.CONSOLE.ID</field>
			<desc>
				<p>Unique reference to identify the MT.TSA.SERVICE.CONSOLE record. The naming convention is flexible and allows for meaningful names to be used which match the purpose of the records. </p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Allowed maximum of 50 alphanumerics.</p>
			</desc>
		</t>
		<t>
			<field>TSA.SERVICE.ID</field>
			<desc>
				<p>Specifies the TSA.SERVICE id, which can be used to control whether the current console record is to handle COB or Service. </p>
				<p>This can be used to form final TSA.SERVICE.ID based on COB or service related fields in same console or from tenant group record.</p>
				<p>COB styles generated can be:</p>
				<p>1. COB-companyGroupId :- If COB.STYLE = COMPANY.GROUP and COMPANY.GROUP.ID has value.</p>
				<p>2. COB-companyId   :- If COB.STYLE = COMPANY and COMPANY.ID has value.</p>
				<p>3. COB  :- Standard COB If COB.STYLE = STANDARD or if no value given in COB related fields in this console.</p>
				<p>Other TSA.SERVICE styles generated can be:</p>
				<p>1. Any TSA.SERVICE (ServiceName without company mnemonic) e.g. GROUP.SERVICE.NAME</p>
				<p>2. Any TSA.SERVICE (ServiceName with company mnemonic prefix) e.g. BNK/SERVICE.NAME </p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Allowed values are:</p>
				<p>1. The literal value of COB.</p>
				<p>2. A valid TSA.SERVICE name in tenant with no company mnemonic prefix.</p>
				<p>Maximum of 50 characters allowed.</p>
				<p>Mandatory field </p>
			</desc>
		</t>
		<t>
			<field>SERVICE.CONTROL</field>
			<desc>
				<p>Specifies the service control value to pass to the COB or Service in the tenant(s) system.</p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Acceptable values are :</p>
				<p>START - The COB or Service is ready to start and can be initiated.</p>
				<p>STOP - The COB or Service has to be stopped. If running it will be terminated.</p>
				<p>AUTO - If  AUTO is specified, then the service is ready for initiation and does not require manual input of START. The service will be available for starting and can be stopped at the end of the process.</p>
				<p>Mandatory field</p>
			</desc>
		</t>
		<t>
			<field>TENANT.ID</field>
			<desc>
				<p>This represents the tenant id(s) for the service or COB being processed.</p>
				<p>The field is multi-valued to allow a list of tenants that will run the same service, with the exception of the 'COB' (that special service can be controlled by using a pre-configured MT.TENANT.GROUP). The COB details needed to be entered for each tenant on this record would be impractical and is best controlled at a group level.</p>
				<p>For a service (other than COB) the associated SERVICE.COMP.MNE will be used to provide the correct runtime value for the service, For example if the same service needs to be run as BNK/SERVICENAME for the first tenant and CO3/SERVICENAME for another tenant then the concatenation of the SERVICE.COMP.MNE/TSA.SERVICE.ID will achieve that.</p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Must be a valid entry in MT.TENANT table.</p>
				<p>Tenant must have the same group type set in TENANT.TYPE.CHECK field</p>
				<p>Mandatory if no TENANT.GROUP is used.</p>
				<p>Multi-values only allowed if TSA.SERVICE.ID is not COB.</p>

				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Maximum of 35 characters allowed. </p>
				<p>If TENANT.GROUP.LEVEL field from TENANT.GROUP is COB, the COB related fields in MT.TSA.SERVICE.CONSOLE cannot be used</p>
				<p>If TENANT.GROUP.LEVEL field from TENANT.GROUP is SERVICE, the service related fields in MT.TSA.SERVICE.CONSOLE cannot be used.</p>
				<p>If TENANT.GROUP.LEVEL field from TENANT.GROUP is GENERIC, then that TENANT.GROUP id itself (only for MT.REPLICATE.CONSOLE) cannot be used in MT.TSA.SERVICE.CONSOLE. </p>
				<p>Must be a valid entry in MT.TENANT.GROUP table.</p>
				<p>Mandatory if no TENANT.ID is used.</p>
			</desc>
		</t>

			<field>SERVICE.COMP.MNE</field>
			<desc>
				<p>Specifies the company mnemonic of the service to be run.</p>
				<p>For a service (other than COB) the associated SERVICE.COMP.MNE will be used to provide the correct runtime value for the service. For example if the same service needs to be run as BNK/SERVICENAME for the first tenant and GB1/SERVICENAME for another tenant then the concatenation of the SERVICE.COMP.MNE/TSA.SERVICE.ID will achieve that.</p>
