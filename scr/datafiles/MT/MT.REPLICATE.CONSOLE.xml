			<p> This is the generic table used to replicate T24 table records (for configuration, parameter, etc.) from Master system to Tenant system(s) in Multi-Tenant architecture.</p>
			<p> Authorization of this table with OPERATION.MODE = EXECUTE will generate event(s) in XML format to the out queue via Integration Framework and external tools (like an ESB) can be used to route these messages into respective tenant(s).  </p>

				<p> 1. Full record creation or replacement in tenant system. </p>
				<p> 2. Amendment of an existing record in tenant system. </p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p></p>
				<p>Valid values are: </p>
				<p>FULL or blank :- Indicates the MT.REPLICATE.CONSOLE record is being created in the master system to perform full record creation or replacement in the tenant system, hence the OFS message will be formed for the full record of TABLE.NAME read with RECORD.ID in master system. </p>
				<P>UPDATE :- Indicates the MT.REPLICATE.CONSOLE record is to do an amendment or update of an existing record in the tenant system.  </P>
				<p>The UPDATE.FIELDS is mandatory if REQUEST.TYPE=UPDATE. </p>
			</desc>
		</t>

			<field>UPDATE.FIELDS</field>
			<desc>

				<p> </p>
				<p>Validation Rules:</p>
				<p>Value allowed only for REQUEST.TYPE=UPDATE. </p>
				<p> Allows only the standard fields of an application which are eligible for input. </p>
				<p> Fields which are not allowed, though may exist in the standard selection record: </p> 
				<p> 	a. NOINPUT and EXTERN fields </p>
				<p> 	b. Key fields (ID type fields) </p>
				<p>     c. Fields with type S, P , I ,J etc. which are not real fields for input in application page. </p>
				<p>  </p>
				<p> When expandable (Multi-value or sub-value type ) fields are entered in UPDATE.FIELDS, an override message will be given. An override class for this can be set-up, if required, to keep control of the impact of updating these fields.</p>
				<p> Since this table is used to manage tables on tenant systems which should not be updated by the tenants themselves it is expected that the format and content of the tenant records are known.</p>
				<p> However, in the event that the tables have been modified locally then only a full record replacement will give the same value as the master record. Updating multi-value or sub-value fields, where the tenant record has those fields modified locally, may not result in an exact duplication on the tenant record. For this reason an override is given to remind (or prevent) such an update.</p>
