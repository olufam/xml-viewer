<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The purpose of this file is to define Limits by Country or Group of Countries.  The System does not attempt to provide real-time information about Country Limit utilisation.  Instead, a report which shows all of the Country Limits and the use made of each is produced at a frequency as defined on the LIMIT.PARAMETER table. </p>
            <p>If it is necessary to define Limits for a Group of Countries, such as the EEC or South America, then the Country Grouping is specified by the Limit Country Group table. </p>
