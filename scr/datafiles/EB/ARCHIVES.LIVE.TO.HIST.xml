            <p>The archives live to hist file holds the instructions for which parameters to apply to which files during the live to hist stage of archiving. </p>
            <p>Each record on the file defines the language to be used in printed output and a time out for the process.  Large files may take some time to be archived since the conditions which must be satisfied can be complex. The time out exists to stop the process after a defined length of time in minutes. The next time the same live to hist is run the process will continue from the point reached in the file last time out. </p>
            <p>Following these fields begins a multivalue set of keys to the parameter file. This is the list of files which will be considered for archiving by this live to hist record. </p>
            <p>The "V" verify function actually invokes the live to hist or alternatively live to hists may be run from within the end of day batch processing. </p>

<field>LAST.KEY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the last key and file being processed when the live to hist timed out on the last run. </p>
            <p>This field will be blank unless the last live to hist run timed out in which case it will contain the filename and record key which was in progress at the time.  This is used to define the point at which to continue in the next live to hist run. </p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

<field>TIME.OUT.MINUTES</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the maximum run time for the live to hist process. </p>
            <p>The time out minutes defines the maximum run time allowed for the live to hist.  When reached the process will terminate with an appropriate message in the batch como or on the screen. </p>
            <p>Next time the live to hist is run the process will continue from the last key used in the file being treated when the process timed out. </p>

            <p>Keys to archives live to hist are descriptively named according to the application they are related to.  They are further subdivided between transaction based files and static tables for each application. </p>
            <p>Examples: FX.TRANS contains parameter records for the foreign exchange           transaction files. </p>
            <p>          LD.TABLES contains parameter records for static tables archiving           within the loans and deposits module. </p>
