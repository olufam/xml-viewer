            <p>Automatic printing of deal slips on input of a contract is available for the Foreign Exchange and Money Market applications. A copy of the record may be requested by setting up an entry on the Deal Slip Parameter file. </p>
            <p>The deal slips are printed according to whatever Version is specified on this table, and are routed to a printer according to a specified Report Control destination. </p>
            <p>Separate parameters are available for the initial input of the contract and for any subsequent amendment. In the latter case, the nature of the amendment is indicated on the print-out (i.e. deletion, additional input, authorisation etc.). </p>
            <p>Use of this table is optional. </p>
