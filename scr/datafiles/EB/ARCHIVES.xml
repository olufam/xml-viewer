            <p>The Archives file holds copies of records which have been selected for archiving from transaction and table files. The ID's to the file are built from the keys to the archives parameter file, which caused the records to be archived appended with the ID of the record itself. In the case of history records this construction is followed by a semi colon and the history number of the record, for live records by ";LIVE", and for the three types of related archiving treatments by "RELARC.n", "RELDEL", or "RELCON". </p>
            <p>A record may be deleted by selecting the Reverse 'R' option and entering the filename and ID name separated by an underscore character " ". This will cause the record and all its associated history records and related file treatments to be removed from the Archives file and hence from any further treatment by the Archiving system. </p>
