            <p>This application is used to only test the rounding rule definition.</p>
            <p>The following fields may be input:</p>
            <p>o Description</p>
            <p>o Currency</p>
            <p>o Rounding Rule</p>
            <p>o Un-rounded Amount</p>
            <p />
            <p>Once the record is verified,  the application uses the rounding rule definition to perform the rounding accordingly on that amount.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The following values are returned:</p>
            <p />
            <p>o The rounded amount</p>
            <p>o The rounding parameter used for the rounding</p>
            <p>o The rounding type used for the rounding</p>
            <p>o The Minimum unit used if one has been defined.</p>

<field>ROUNDING.RULE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This defines whether  a rounding rule is to  be used for the rounding calculation.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If it is not set then the TEST.ROUNDING uses the rounding definition at the Currency level defined in the TEST.ROUNDING record.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If it is set then, the application fetches the rounding rule information defining the rounding type and  any minimum unit  to be used. The other required information are retrieved from the Currency record.</p>

<field>ROUNDING.PARAM</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field indicates what parameter has been used for the rounding. The possible values are ‘ROUNDING.RULE’ and ‘CURRENCY’.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If no rounding rule has been defined in the TEST.ROUNDING  record, then ‘CURRENCY’ is returned.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If a rounding rule has been defined in the TEST.ROUNDING record, then ‘ROUNDING.RULE’ is returned.</p>
            <p>The only  exception is  when the ROUNDING.TYPE in the EB.ROUNDING.RULE is set to ‘CURRENCY’ or ‘NONE’, in this case ‘CURRENCY’ is returned.</p>

<field>ROUNDING.TYPE</field>

            <p>The following values may be returned:</p>
            <p>A value of  ‘1’, indicates a  natural rounding  has been effected</p>
            <p>A value of ‘2’, indicates a rounding down has been effected</p>
            <p>A value  of ‘3’, indicates a rounding up has been effected.</p>
            <p />

<field>CURRENCY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Currency of the amount to be rounded. Any other rounding definition such as, NO.OF.DECIMALS, CASH.ONLY.ROUNDING, MIN.ROUND.AMOUNT are fetched from the currency record as defined here.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

<field>DESCRIPTION</field>

            <p>This describes the TEST.ROUNDING record</p>
        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>MIN.ROUND.AMT</field>
<desc>
            <p>This indicates  whether the minimum amount, or the lowest unit of currency defined in the TEST.ROUNDING, has been used for  rounding the input amount.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The TEST.ROUNDING application either returns blank or the actual  minimum unit used for the rounding.</p>
            <p>If this field is returned with a blank, then the rounding has been done to the NO.OF.DECIMAL.PLACES in the Currency record.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Note:  Even if in the Currency record a MIN.ROUND.AMOUNT is defined and if  in  the  EB.ROUNDING.RULE, the USE.MIN.UNIT has not been set to ‘Y’ , then  the NO.OF.DECIMAL.PLACES in the Currency record is used.</p>
            <p>In this case a blank value is returned in the field MIN.ROUND.AMT.</p>
