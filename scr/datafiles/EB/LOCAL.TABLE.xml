            <p>Local elements may be defined for Applications which have a Local Reference field, (e.g. the CURRENCY file), and enable you to create additional Input fields which may be needed to meet local requirements. </p>
            <p>This table allows the specific details of such fields to be defined, including, the name of the Input field, the minimum and maximum number of characters, the type of characters, all possible Input values and whether the Input is to be Validated against the key of another table. </p>

<field>DECISION</field>

            <p>Specifies the standard decision formats used to check for matching/non-matching values in either DECIS FIELD or REPLACE FLD. </p>
            <p>The value of the field in either DECIS FIELD or REPLACE FIELD will be checked according to this decision ie: </p>
            <p>          MM.MONEY.MARKET Field 7 'EQ' 21001 </p>

<field>MAXIMUM.CHAR</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the maximum number of characters that may be entered in this Local Table element. </p>
            <p>This field is used to control the maximum number of characters (up to 35) allowed for this Local Table element. If the format is an amount, note that 6 of these characters are accounted for as decimals. </p>
            <p>To allow leading spaces, and free text where more than one space is allowed between characters, the max characters should be prefixed with a space. </p>
            <p>To allow zero as an amount, this field should be prefixed with a zero. To allow leading zeroes in a number, prefix the max. length with two zeroes. </p>
            <p>If Field 18 (APPLICATION VET) is entered, then any input to this field must comply with the requirements of the specified Application e.g. if Field 18 is Country, which has a 2 character key, Field 3 is only allowed to be 2 characters. </p>
            <p>If this field is left blank and APPLICATION.VET (Field 18) is defined, then the maximum allowed number of character is taken from MAX.LENGTH field of EB.OBJECT table if exist or it is defaulted from standard selection</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

            <p>When this field is specified, we enable two optional routines for the application which uses this local reference field, optional routine names and the behaviours are illustrated below</p>
            <p>   1.	LRF.(shortname of LOCAL.TABLE).PROCESS – would be called just before unauthorized state of the application but after the template Process state of the application </p>
            <p>   2.	LRF.(shortname of LOCAL.TABLE).AUTHORISE – would be called just before the auth state of the application.</p>
