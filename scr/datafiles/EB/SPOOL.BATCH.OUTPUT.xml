            <p>This application is run, in Verify mode, to spool all the output from an end of day run. The output is sorted by Departement, User (who requested the output), and by report name. </p>
            <p>The output from the last five end of day runs is maintained by the Report Control System, hence it is possible to re-spool the complete batch output from a previous end of day run. </p>
            <p>This is maintained regardless of the SPF Hold Batch Output flag. It is possible to allow the immediate spool of batch output, in which case it will be printed in run order, and still re-spool the output in department, user, name sorted order. </p>
            <p>Two options are allowed, to direct all the output to a specific printer and to supress the printing of 'unrequested reports'. </p>
            <p>A 'dispatch list' is spooled at the start of the run detailing the department, user and the requested reports. </p>
