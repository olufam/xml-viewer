            <p>This table will provide the user with the facility of translating into the various languages defined on the LANGUAGE table: </p>
            <p>           1)   All the field names (prompts) of each Application                 (including internal fields) and </p>
            <p>           2)   General T24 System messages as detailed later                 on under the ID 'GLOBAL TEXT'. </p>
            <p>For each language existing on the LANGUAGE table, the user will have the facility to enter the applicable translations.  It must be noted immediately that, for performance reasons, the English translation of field names (see 1 above) will be ignored by the System. </p>
            <p>English translation of 'GLOBAL TEXT' messages, on the contrary, will be recognised. </p>
            <p>The English names of the fields will be taken directly from the program. Translation of field names in other languages will be recognised and used in accordance with the language code defined in the corresponding user profile. </p>

            <p>Identifies the second language text field which allows the user to enter the translation text in the language specified in the 3 dots preceding the literal 'TEXT' (...TEXT). </p>
            <p>1)   When the ID is an existing Application name: </p>
            <p>           -    Each text field where the user has started to enter                 translations must be expanded up to the exact                 number of fields of the corresponding application. </p>
            <p>           -    The Text which can be input will be limited to 18                 characters for a single value field, 15 characters                 for a multivalue field and 12 characters for a                 subvalue field. </p>
            <p>           -    The text for a multivalue field must start with                 'XX.' followed by the translation desired by the                 user. </p>
            <p>           -    When there is an association of fields, instead of                 the dot, the '&lt;' sign must be indicated after the                 first field of the association, the '&gt;' after the last                 field of the association, the '-' sign on any field in                 the middle of the association. </p>

            <p>           -    Association of subvalue fields will follow the same                 logic but the indication will now be done by 4 'X'                 ie. XX.XX with the applicable addition of the                 signs '.', '&lt;', '-', or '&gt;'. </p>

            <p>           -    Each expansion of a text field will correspond to                 the next field of the corresponding application.                 At the same time, the original text (from the                 program) will be displayed on the right hand side                 of the screen. </p>
            <p>           -    Once the user has started to define some field                 names in one language, he will be forced to at                 least complete the translation of all the fields in                 this language. </p>
