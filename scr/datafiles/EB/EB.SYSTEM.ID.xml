            <p>The application EB.SYSTEM.ID is used to provide a description of the SYSTEM.ID field in the accounting entry files, STMT.ENTRY, CATEG.ENTRY, CONSOL.NET.TODAY and RE.CONSOL.SPEC.ENTRY. </p>
            <p>The application also holds additional details of the underlying application record which was responsible for raising the entries. This may then be used to allow the correct drill-down in entry based enquiries. </p>
