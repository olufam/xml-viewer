            <p>This file holds the parameters that will be used to assign the tape unit and to select the report/delivery output that is to be saved to magnetic tape ready for microfiching. </p>
            <p>It allows the user to define the tape unit and density to be used, what is to be saved to tape, the fiche title, sort fields for delivery output, the fiche cycle name and the cut off date and time for selecting the items. </p>

<field>TAPE.CREATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Universe command or routine name to be executed for each report to be fiched. Rather than attempt to hard code the format for each fiche tape this field allows you to control the format of each report as it is processed. This could be as simple as copying the report to another directory for later processing or you could write your own routine to format the reports for a specific microfiche package. </p>
            <p>Fields may be used in the command sentence with the intention of having them replaced by T24 before the sentence is executed.  In this case they must be of the following format: </p>
            <p>       i) A valid entry on FILE.CONTROL </p>
            <p>      ii) Followed by '&gt;' (greater than sign) </p>
            <p>     iii) Plus a valid multivalue entry in SYS.FIELD.NAME on           STANDARD.SELECTION </p>
            <p>      iv) The whole to be contained within '&amp;' (ampersand). </p>
            <p>For example any item from FICHE.HOLD.CONTROL could have its report name, say 'CRF.CNTRL' translated through REPORT.CONTROL to extract the local reference which could be used to provide the output ID. </p>
            <p>For example: </p>
            <p>The Unix 'cat' command may be used to concatenate data being processed by this application into the area to be accessed by a microfiche system. In the case of a FICHE.HOLD.CONTROL item identified as '8633474800' a command entered thus: </p>
            <p>          SH -c "cat F.FICHE.HOLD/&amp;FICHE.HOLD.CONTROL&gt;@ID&amp;              &gt; /oplink/&amp;REPORT.CONTROL&gt;OPLINK.ID&amp;" </p>
            <p>would be translated by T24 into the following executable command: </p>
            <p>          SH -c "cat F.FICHE.HOLD/8633474800 &gt; /oplink/reval" </p>
            <p>The effect of this command would be to concatenate each report, with the same OPLINK.ID (a local reference on REPORT.CONTROL) into a directory called /oplink. </p>
            <p>If you were writing a DataBasic program to process the report then arguments could be supplied in the same manner as above and accessed in your program using the variable @SENTENCE. e.g: </p>
            <p>          OPLINK.FORMATTER &amp;FICHE.HOLD.CONTROL&gt;@ID&amp; </p>
            <p>In your routine, OPLINK.FORMATTER, @SENTENCE would equal "OPLINK.FORMATTER 8633474800", which you could then use to read the F.FICHE.HOLD record to format it to your requiremnets and the write it to another file/directory. </p>
            <p>The existence of a command in this field will cause the run program to perform the command instead of writing to tape. </p>
            <p>UNIX commands must also be enclosed within quotation marks, specify full path names where necessary and be preceded by the UNIVERSE command: SH -c. </p>
            <p>This field is multi-valued to allow for multiple commands, executed in sequence for each report, and sub-valued for lengthy commands. Where a command needs to be split over a number of sub-values care should be taken regarding spaces and separators - individual sub-values are simply concatenated together prior to execution. </p>
