            <p>Warning: Changing this field after files have been uploaded means the system will no longer be able to find uploaded files!</p>
            <p />
            <p>This field must be the same as the &lt;UPLOAD_PATH&gt; in the tcserver.xml &lt;LISTENER&gt; used for file uploads. If they are different, files will be uploaded but EB.FILE.UPLOAD records will not validate.</p>
            <p>The TC server process must have permissions to write to the upload directory (specified in this field and the EB.FILE.UPLOAD.TYPE / UPLOAD.DIR field).</p>
            <p />
            <p>Mandatory field. 1-150 characters allowed.</p>
