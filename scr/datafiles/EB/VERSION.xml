<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>All T24 screens have been designed within a set structure and most Data Sections of the screen are very similar (one field per line with enrichment of 35 characters per field).</p>
            <p>The VERSION file has been developed to enable Users to redesign the Data Section (line 5 to line 20) of any T24. screen to suit their own preferences/requirements. An infinite number of versions of each screen can be created, and are then called up by appending ',X' (where X = Version identity) to the Application name.</p>
            <p>Basically, the VERSION file is organised in three sections:</p>
            <p>1.         The first section defines general information such as :</p>
            <p>. Print or Screen identification.            . Number of records per page.            . Number of fields per line.            . Languages.            . Headers.</p>
            <p>2.         The second section enables the layout of fields to be            arranged on the screen, field descriptions to be            defined in any language and length of enrichments to            be specified.</p>
            <p>3.         The third section enables the User to define operating            conditions specific to the Version being created by            means of parameters such as :</p>
            <p>. Number of authorisation(s)            . Definition of 'No-input' fields            . Definition of 'No-change' fields            . Fields to be rekeyed for authorisation            . Automatic default values</p>

            <p>Populating DISPLAY.TYPE with NULL will have no change on the version field.</p>
            <p>TOGGLE will change the field in a button labelled with the field name; the TOGGLE button can display two states only by appearing in white or grey.</p>
            <p>The COMBOBOX option displays checkbox fields (only) as comboboxes</p>
            <p>The VERTICAL.OPTIONS option displays radio button vertically as opposed to the normal way which is horisontaly.</p>
            <p>The NODISPLAY option allow us to decide whether the field should be displayed or not</p>

            <p>The Language codes in Field 4 define the languages of the headings in the corresponding group of Fields 5 to 12 (e.g. if Field 4.2 specifies French, the System assumes that headings in Fields 5.2 to 12.2 are in French and will display them for Users whose Profiles specify French).</p>
            <p>If the standard Version of the Application displays information on header line 3, the heading defined in this field will be overwritten.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Note:      When this field is expanded to define the headers in            various languages, the user should enter these in the            same language sequence as the one defined in            LANGUAGE CODE (Field 4).</p>

            <p>Text or Prompt</p>
            <p>Indicates the Text that User wants to define for the field specified in FIELD NO (Field 13). This is a sub-value field which can be expanded by itself to allow the Text to be entered in the various languages defined in Language code field.</p>
            <p>If no Text is entered by the User, the Version screen will be presented without any Text for this specific field. Spaces which are created by the User in this field will not be ignored.</p>
            <p>Optionally the number of the field can also be displayed by the System in front of the Text itself. If required, it should be defined before the Text as follows:</p>
            <p>1. For Single fields enter in this field N, NN or NNN according to the size of the field i.e. N if field number is between 1 and 9, NN if field number is between 10 and 99 and NNN if field number is between 100 and 999. Example : N MNEMONIC</p>
            <p>2. For Multivalue fields enter in this field N, NN, or NNN as appropriate followed by a space and XX. Example : N XX RELATION</p>
            <p>3. For Sub-value fields enter in this field N, NN or NNN (as appropriate) followed by a space, XX, a second space and a second XX.Example : N XX XX FIELD NAME</p>
            <p>The Language codes define the language of the Text in the corresponding group of fields (e.g. if the second LANGUAGE.CODE specifies French, the system assumes that second group of text fields are in French and will display them for users whose profiles specify French).</p>

            <p>Input in this field is not allowed when FIELDS PER LINE         (Field 3) = 1 unless FIELD NO (Field 13) equals '*'.</p>
            <p>Input in this field is not allowed when FIELD NO is         missing.</p>
            <p>The maximum length of Text which can be input in this         field (including the field number itself if specified)         cannot exceed 39 characters unless FIELD NO (Field 13)         contains an '*'.</p>
            <p>Input in this field is not allowed when the corresponding         Language code has not been defined. If, for example, this         subvalue field has been expanded by means of the ')' sign         and LANGUAGE CODE (Field 4) has not been expanded, input         in sub-value 2 will then be refused because the language         2 was not previously defined.</p>

<field>TABLE.COLUMN</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates to the User the length and start-position of the field being defined.  This field is generated automatically by the System.</p>
            <p>This information, generated automatically by the System, allows the User to check on-line the position on the screen of the different fields being creating in the Version. The User must also consider that the additional two spaces, required to separate the two different fields, has also been calculated by the System.</p>
            <p>The format of the field thus defines:</p>
            <p>1.         In which column the Text previously defined will start            and,</p>
            <p>2.         the total length generated by the field (including            Text, input itself and the enrichment defined in the            previous fields and necessary spaces between fields on            the same line).</p>
            <p>Example:</p>

            <p>1    indicates that the field starts in column 1 and</p>
            <p>18   indicates that the field uses 18 columns on the                 screen or report.</p>
            <p>In the above example (1|18), the System is telling the User that this field will start in column 1 and uses in total 18 columns.  If he wants to define a second field on the same line, the second field can only be defined starting from at least column 19 i.e. 1 + 18.  If the User enters a column number smaller than 19, the System would then automatically place this field on the next line.</p>

            <p>This field is used to define whether a VERSION can be restricted to being run only in a users initial sign on company, and can only be input when the multi branch product is installed.</p>
            <p>Multi branch indicates that the MB product is installed, the term Multi Book can also be used.</p>
            <p>This product basically allows financial level data to be stored in the same database table for all companies, as opposed to Multi Company where the data is stored in a separate table for each company.</p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>Must be a valid version, and must relate to the same application as the version being input.</p>

<field>AUTO.COMP.CHANGE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is used to define in a multi branch system whether the user can directly access a record in another company, without having to manually exit the application, sign in to the other company and invoke the application.</p>
            <p>Multi branch indicates that the MB product is installed, the term Multi Book can also be used.</p>
            <p>This product basically allows financial level data to be stored in the same database table for all companies, as opposed to Multi Company where the data is stored in a separate table for each company.</p>
            <p>If this field is set to YES then the user can enter access a record in another company to perform a transaction. The user must have access to the other company via the OTH.BOOK.ACCESS or OTH.BOOK.BLOCK fields of their USER record.</p>
            <p>The user does not need to have the ability to sing in to the other company.</p>
            <p>An SMS check will be applied for the current application and function before the new company is loaded automatically.</p>
            <p>An example would be when a customer wishes to close an account in a branch other than their own, in this case the teller would enter the account number, the system would then switch companies and the account can be closed.</p>
            <p>If this field is left blank then in a multi branch environment the user will not be allowed to directly access records in other branches, but must be signed in to that company.</p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

<field>NAU.PROCESSING</field>
<desc>
            <p>NAU.PROCESSING</p>
            <p>This field facilitates to specify optional functionality for the processing of transactions via OFS where $NAU records exist.</p>
            <p>This field helps to handle situations where data is passed through OFS to T24 and records with the same ID exist on the $NAU files.</p>
            <p>This field has the following options:</p>
            <p>0. Reject messages where an NAU record exists.</p>
            <p>1. Overwrite NAU record with OFS data, i.e. fields from the OFS record will be written to the NAU record. If the VERSION has 0 authorisers and the user associated with the OFS message, is the only user on the NAU record then process as normal. If the USERs are not the same, write the OFS field data onto the NAU record and write the record to the unauthorised file.</p>
            <p>2. Accept Reversal as Deletion (or deletion of NAU record + reversal of live record if live record exists) if an NAU record exists.</p>
            <p>3. Apply both option 1 and option 2 to this version. i.e. If OFS transaction is an Input then process as per option 1. If OFS transaction is Reversal process as per option 2.</p>
            <p>If the field is left empty the existing functionality will apply.</p>

<field>INITIAL.CURSOR.POS</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the Field Name which the User wants to be first active in the Version. When the Version is launched the Initial Cursor Position would be at this field.</p>
            <p>Input, Internal and External fields can be specified as the initial cursor position. Local Reference Fields are not valid.</p>
            <p>Field names can be entered in the following format:</p>
            <p>a) Field name (e.g. MNEMONIC for field 1 in the customer file followed by,</p>
            <p>b) '-' when the User wants to define a multivalue field, followed by,</p>
            <p>c) Value Number (e.g. RELATION-1 for RELATION in the customer file) when the User wants to define multivalue fields, followed by,</p>

            <p>e) Sub-Number when the User wants to define a subvalue field.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, field names can be entered as field numbers as follows:</p>
            <p>a) Field name (e.g. 1 for mnemonic in the customer file followed by,</p>
            <p>b) '.' when the User wants to define a multivalue field, followed by,</p>
            <p>c) Value Number (e.g. 7.1 for RELATION in the customer file) when the User wants to define multivalue fields, followed by,</p>
            <p>d) '.' when the User wants to define a subvalue field, followed by,</p>
            <p>e) Sub-Number when the User wants to define a subvalue field.</p>
            <p>Field numbers will be translated to field names when entered.</p>
            <p>The Field Name which is set must be defined in the Version Record.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

<field>EXPANSION</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates whether the Field Number previously defined can be expanded when using this Version in an on-line session.</p>
            <p>This field should only be used when FIELDS PER LINE (Field 3) is equal to MULTI and the User does not want to allow expansion for multivalue and sub-value fields.  If this field is left blank, the multivalue or sub-value field can then be expanded on-line when using this Version [by means of the '&gt;' or ')' sign] and all existing values will be displayed.  This field can only be used for multivalue and sub-value fields.  Only the value(s) defined in the various occurrences of FIELD NO. will be displayed, even if the application record contains more values.</p>
            <p>Example:            Let us suppose that Field 12 (OTHER OFFICER) from            the CUSTOMER file has been defined as follows :</p>
            <p>12.1 with column 1, 12.2 with column 40 and the field            Expansion has been left blank.  In this case, column 1            will be used for Fields 12.1, 12.3, 12.5 etc... while            column 40 will be used for Fields 12.2, 12.4, 12.6            etc...</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>NO   The User will not be able to expand the multivalue or sub-value field. blankIt can be expanded by the User during the on-line session when using this Version. Multivalue field associated with Fields 13 to 23. (Optional input. Default value = blank.)</p>
            <p>Input in this field is only allowed when FIELDS PER LINE (Field 3) contains Multi.</p>
            <p>Input of NO in this field is mandatory when the field defined in FIELD NO. (Field 13) is a Local Reference data element and FIELDS PER LINE contains Multi.</p>
            <p>The system will not accept a mix of Expansion and No Expansion of fields with the same field number or fields in the same group of associated fields.  For example, Field 12 (OTHER OFFICER) from the CUSTOMER file cannot be defined as 12.1 with expansion and 12.2 without expansion. In the same way, the associated RELATION fields of the CUSTOMER file cannot be defined as 7.1 with expansion, 8.1 also with expansion and 9.1 without expansion.</p>

<field>ATTRIBS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field defines a number of Attributes for the Version.</p>
            <p>This includes whether the field is a Hot Field or not.  This causes the contract to be validated when the       user exits the field thus displaying all errors for the current       contract.  Marking a field as a Hot Field will also ensure that the       application is called when the field is exited.  Therefore, this       mechanism can be used to default other field values once the current field       value has been entered.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>HOT.FIELD - This indicates that the field is a Hot Field in the Browser.</p>
            <p>ENRICHMENT.ONLY - If a field is NOINPUT then display the enrichment in place of the field. If inputtable then display Enrichment only via a control.</p>
            <p>POPUP.DROPDOWN - If this field has a dropdown then set behaviour to popup in new window with paging tools.</p>

The Version screen presented to the User will then contain text in the appropriate language according to the Language code defined in the User's Profile.</p>
            <p>It will not be possible to define the headers, the names of the fields and the remark lines in different languages unless these languages have been defined in this field.</p>
            <p>The first language defined in this field (i.e. the first occurrence within the multivalue set) will be used as the default language for all Users whose language (as specified in their User's Profile) has not been defined in this Version.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

            <p>This first heading line will appear on line number 2 in the header lines.  Spaces will not be ignored.</p>
            <p>The Language codes define the languages of the headings in the corresponding group of Fields 5 to 12 (e.g. if Field 4.2 specifies French, the System assumes that headings in Fields 5.2 to 12.2 are in French and will display them for Users whose Profiles specify French).</p>
            <p />
            <p>Note:      When this field is expanded to define the headers in            various languages, the user should enter these in the            same language sequence as the one defined in            LANGUAGE CODE (Field 4).</p>

            <p />
            <p>The name, or an Abbreviation, for the Application of which a Version is required must be entered followed by a comma. In cases where more than one Version exists, each Version must be specified by appending further unique identity.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Symbols and Special Characters for eg: ( !@#$% ) can used to form the id for version, but the same cannot be used in the VERSION field in USER and USER.SMS.GROUP applications. Hence versions with symbols and special characters will not be accepted in USER and USER.SMS.GROUP applications.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>The following is a list of possible ID's for the creation of various Versions for the CUSTOMER file:</p>
            <p>. Customer,1 . Customer,99 . Customer,abc</p>

            <p>It must be prefixed by a valid     Application name or abbreviation of a valid application name.</p>
            <p>The Version identity must not     be greater than 22 characters.</p>
            <p>The Version identity cannot be     'O' as this identifies the standard Version when defining S.M.S.     restrictions.</p>

            <p>This field allows the User to define his own operating conditions according to the type of product.  The number of authoriser(s) to be involved can therefore be defined at the Application level which will allow the User, for example, to create a Version of the Customer file with one authoriser and a Version for the Money Market Application with two authorisers.</p>

            <p>NORMAL  the branch is open on an official working day</p>
            <p>RESTRICTED  the branch is open on an official holiday, e.g. a weekend or public holiday</p>
            <p>CLOSED  the branch is closed i.e. the holiday table for the branch indicates a non working day, or the day corresponds to a value on the BRNACH.CLOSED field for the company</p>
            <p>For example some business activities can only take place on an official working day such as certain clearing transactions, whereas others e.g. closing a customer account can take place if the branch is open.</p>

<desc>
            <p>The value(s) defined here are used to produce Deal Slips according to the function and whether the user wants to have them produced automatically or when a 'hot key' is used. Deal Slips can be printed to a connected local printer or directed to a Network device. Refer to the REPORT CONTROL section of the Systems Administration User Guide for details of setting up printers.</p>
            <p>Deal slips can be linked to a function such as Input, Reversal or Authorisation and specific Deal Slips can be made to relate to those functions.</p>
            <p>Either an ENQUIRY record or a DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT record can be entered. If a valid DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT then the system will provide an enrichment from the record so the user will know thay have the correct record.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, an ENQUIRY record can be used to provide a Deal Slip, in this case the enrrichment will inform the user that an ENQUIRY record has been selected.</p>
            <p>The user can drilldown to the related table DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT to view or select the record to use.</p>
            <p>The combination of the associated fields is used to define when the Deal Slip can be produced.</p>

            <p>Note:</p>
            <p>ENQUIRY linked Deal Slips are valid for Desktop (GUI) use only. Since the ENQUIRY will be based on either the live or unauthorised file then only data that is available on those files can be accessed, whereas DEAL.SLIP.FORMAT can utilise the new data being entered on a deal. ENQUIRY deal slips therefore need to be based on the live or unauthorised record depending on when the deal slip is being produced. For example a new deal would probably be based on the unauthorised record whereas a reversal would be based on the live record.</p>

            <p>Enables the User to define the new automatic default value. Must be used in conjunction with AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT (Field 44) and AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER (Field 43).</p>
            <p>A routine (preceded by "@") may be specified instead of actual values. The routine will only be executed if the EXC.INC.RTN field is set to Y.</p>
            <p>Input in this field must be in accordance with the field definition of the selected Application. Quotes should only be used where the new data actually requires quotes e.g if a new value is required to be YES it should not be input as "YES".</p>
            <p>It is important to clearly understand the relation between this field and AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT. The following examples will clarify their use.</p>
            <p>1. When the User wants to create an automatic default at the creation of new record ID's, he should then make the following input in these three fields :</p>
            <p>AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicates the field number for which you want to create an automatic default. AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Must remain blank. AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the value which you want to default automatically.</p>
            <p>2. When you want to replace automatically an old content by a new content, you should then make the following input in these three fields :</p>
            <p>AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicate the field number for which you want to change automatically the old content.</p>
            <p>AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Enter the old content AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the new content which you want to replace automatically.</p>
            <p>3. When you want to run a subroutine which will default a value in a particular field, you should make the following input in these three fields :</p>
            <p>AUTOMATIC FIELD NUMBER - Indicates the field number for which you want to create a automatic default AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT - Must remain blank AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT - Enter the subroutine name</p>
            <p>which needs to be executed for the the field in AUTOMATIC.FIELD.NUMBER.</p>
            <p>Note: If the field AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT is specified, only records containing the specified value will be changed when using this Version.</p>
            <p>If the field AUTOMATIC OLD CONTENT is not specified, the content specified in the field AUTOMATIC NEW CONTENT (Field 44) will be generated when creating a new record with this Version.</p>
            <p>The value of the AUT.NEW.CONTENT field can be set using a system (e.g. TODAY, COMPANY, etc.) or user-defined (e.g. CURRENT.CUSTOMER, CURRENT.ACCOUNT, etc.) variable.  In order to use the value of a variable an "!" character must be used preceding the variable name.  For example, a field can be defaulted to today's date by using "!TODAY" or the value of a user defined variable containing a customer number by using "!CURRENT.CUSTOMER".</p>

<field>NOINPUT.FIELD</field>
<desc>
            <p>Provides the User with the facility to define some fields as fully protected so that, when using this Version, it will be impossible to input to, or amend the content of, these fields.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that the field name input automatically includes all possible value and sub-value fields of that field. (Local Reference fields can also be input.)</p>
            <p>A typical example of use of this facility could be illustrated by a Money Market contract or Foreign Exchange transaction which has been initiated in the dealing room (1st level input) and which will be completed by the back-office department.  Very often, the input from the dealer has to be protected and could only be changed by himself. It is then possible to define a Version for the back-office department which, by the use of this field, can restrict the back-office staff from amending the data input in the dealing room.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

            <p>Input of field names relating to Internal or External fields (i.e. fields generated automatically by the System) is not allowed because, by definition, these fields are already non-input fields.</p>
            <p>Input in this field is not allowed when PRINT ONLY =  Y.</p>

<field>HDR.2.001..039</field>
<desc>
            <p>Enables the second line of headings for columns 01 to 39, of the screen or printed report, to be specified.</p>
            <p>This second heading line will appear on line number 3 in the header lines.  Spaces will not be ignored.  When the ID is displayed on line 3 (see value of REFERENCE NO IN 1ST LINE, Field 25), this header will only be displayed starting from page 2.</p>
            <p>The Language codes define the languages of the headings in the corresponding group of Fields 5 to 12 (e.g. if Field 4.2 specifies French, the System assumes that headings in Fields 5.2 to 12.2 are in French and will display them for Users whose Profiles specify French).</p>
            <p>If the standard Version of the Application displays information on header line 3, the heading defined in this Field will be overwritten.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Note:      When this field is expanded to define the headers in            various languages, the user should enter these in the            same language sequence as the one defined in            LANGUAGE CODE (Field 4).</p>

                                    with the TARGET field mapped to the Version/Function and a new record is created in EB.SERVICE with the activity added to it.</p>
            <p> If the SERVICE is existing EB.SERVICE and ACTIVITY does not exist in PW.ACTIVITY,a new activity is created in PW.ACTIVITY and the same is appended to the EB.SERVICE record.</p>
            <p> If SERVICE does not exist and ACTIVITY exists, a check is done to ensure that the activity relates to this Version/Function, i.e. the TARGET field in PW.ACTIVITY is mapped correctly, otherwise an error message is thrown. Then, a new EB.SERVICE record is created with the activity added to it.</p>
            <p> If both SERVICE and ACTIVITY exists and the activity relates to the Version/Function, a check is done to ensure that the EB.SERVICE does not contain the ACTIVITY.ID already.Otherwise an error message is thrown. Finally,EB.SERVICE is updated with the activity appended to it.</p>
