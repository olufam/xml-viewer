For all range of categories defined here, PD.PARAMETER should exist with following values set SUB.PAY.SETTING YES CHANGE.STATUS NULL NAB.PERIOD.INT NO If PD.PARAMETER does not exist for this category ID, default set-up (with COMPANY ID) would be considered for the check. All categories within CATEG.FR and CATEG.TO will have to satisfy the above criteria. </p>
