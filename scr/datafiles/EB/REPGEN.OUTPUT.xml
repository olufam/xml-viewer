            <p>OVERVIEW FOR REPGEN OUTPUT </p>
            <p>The module REPGEN.OUTPUT allows selection of a report for print or display on the screen.  It also contains the definition of the language (code) in which the report headers, titles and labels must be printed.  It provides for extra copies to be printed and the definition of a special page length for the printing of the report.  The work file between the Sort and Printed can be requested to be deleted. </p>
            <p>The ID of the file is a user-defined name or the report name itself.  If both print and display is required and/or different languages need to be output, the use of an ID different to the report is mandatory and the report name becomes an attribute in field 3. </p>
            <p>The language formats, i.e. the definition of the languages used and the corresponding descriptions and headers need to be defined in the file REPGEN.CREATE. </p>
            <p>The output definitions can be entered on-line for an on-line print or display of the report.  The required minimum input is a key, (which is necessary for the execution of the print or the display of the report and can be used each time a request is entered), the execution type (print/display) and the report name. </p>
            <p>The file type of REPGEN.OUTPUT is "W" (workfile) and therefore has a live version only. </p>
            <p>The output definition can be done as maintenance task only, using function "I" (input) or the C(copy) function or as definition and execution task combined using the function "V".  If first defined under "I", later execution on-line must also be triggered using the "V" function. </p>
            <p>If the report needs to be produced as part of the end of day, then a REPGEN.OUTPUT record, for the report, must still exist.  The name given to the REPGEN.OUTPUT record must then be entered as a data item in an appropriate BATCH record and there must be a REPGEN.SORT record with the same name. </p>
            <p>An appropriate Batch record is one that: </p>
            <p>(i)    has a batch job (Field 6) of Batch record that       will call upon the report generator and accept       'data' in the form of a REPGEN.OUTPUT record       (Field 11.1.1 of the BATCH.RECORD). </p>
            <p>      e.g. EB.PRINT </p>
            <p>(ii)   Is to be executed at the desired stage in the       end of the day run. </p>
            <p>      e.g. before or after the date change. </p>
            <p>If the REPGEN.CREATE record has been updated since the last run of REPGEN.SOURCE, an override message will be output. </p>
