            <p>T24 currently has multiple methods to identify the unique session number for a given port. This varies from the SESSION.NO common variable to @USERNO jBase variable. There is lack of consistency and there is no single and central controlling mechanism for the session number.</p>
            <p />
            <p>To overcome this, it is decided that T24 on its entry point will allocate a number which is unique to the T24 session . There are two entry points to T24. One is T24.INITIALISE which allows online access to T24 (viz. tSS/JCA/Classic and Desktop Sessions do this).  The other entry point to T24 is tSA which is the service agent that runs/monitors the various services that run in T24.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The idea is to merge these into one and introduce a session number allocation mechanism</p>
            <p />
            <p>The record created will get deleted once the user logs off or the session gracefully expires.</p>
