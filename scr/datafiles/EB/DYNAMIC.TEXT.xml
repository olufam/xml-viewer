            <p>From this table the user should use the facility of translating into the various languages defined on the LANGUAGE table: </p>
            <p>        o    all the fields in each record application. </p>
            <p>        o    all the various error messages existing within the various              applications of T24. </p>
            <p>        o    Various general system messages not included in the list of              'GLOBAL.TEXT' from the STATIC.TEXT facility.  Such messages              will include Text such as </p>
            <p>             - (AFTER.TOO.MANY.ATTEMPTS)              - PLEASE.KEY.IN.OPERATOR.NAME              - (CANCEL.DEACTIVATION.PERIOD)              - 1.=.CHANGE.PASSWORD                etc. </p>
            <p>For each language existing on the LANGUAGE table, the user will have the facility to enter the applicable translations.  It must be noted immediately that, for performance reasons, the English translation of the messages entered in the first field (TEXT 1) will be ignored by the system.  The English text of the messages will be taken directly from the program.  Translation of messages in other languages will be recognised and used in accordance with the language code defined in the corresponding user profile. </p>
