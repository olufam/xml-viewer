            <p>This Application is used to generate outward claim files online, by Verifying an appropriate DD.PARAMETER Id.</p>
            <p>It has the option of not updating the file which allows a sample view of the contents of the file without actually updating related DD applications.</p>
            <p>The list of DD.ITEM which has the status as "NEW.ITEM" or "RESUBMITTED.ITEM" &amp; their underlying DDI's status as "ACTIVE" are picked up during file generation process.</p>
            <p> After the file is generated with Update files set to "Y", the individual DD.ITEM record status is set to "CLAIM.SENT" and DD.HEADER is updated with Item details.</p>
            <p>Once the Items are  included in the File, these items are skipped during the next file generation process.</p>
            <p>In case file is not generated during Online process then the claim file gets generated as an End of Day batch process based on the CLAIM.DATE.PRD set in DD.PARAMETER.</p>
