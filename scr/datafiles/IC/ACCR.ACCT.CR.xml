<ovdesc>

            <p>This is an internal file containing details of the calculation of Credit Interest for accrual (updating Profit and Loss). </p>
            <p>  Interest is accrued at every monthend (on the day specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL table) and whenever it is capitalised. </p>
            <p>  ACCR.ACCT.CR records contain details of credit interest which has been accrued but not yet capitalised (booked to the Customer's Account). At each month end the interest accrued since the last capitalisation is recalculated, the appropriate Profit and Loss entries are generated and a new ACCR.ACCT.CR record is written, replacing the one generated the previous month. When the interest is capitalised, a STMT.ACCT.CR record is written and the ACCR.ACCT.CR record is deleted. </p>
            <p>  Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing. </p>
            <p>  The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Credit Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP.DATE.CR.INT field). </p>
            <p>  The last balance included is the one with Value Date equal to the month end date specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record. The month end accrual calculations are always inclusive of the balance on the month end day. </p>

<field>CR.INT.DATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>The start date of a period, during which the ACCOUNT has been in credit and credit interest has been calculated.  Associated fields show the number of days of the calculation, the applicable rate, the balance and the calulated amount of interest. If either the rate or the balance change, a further set of associated fields will be generated. </p>
            <p>  Any change to the interest calculation will cause the generation of a new set of multivalue field range CR.INT.DATE to CR.INT.AMT.  These changes include: </p>
            <p>             Change to Balance            Interest Rate            Interest Days Basis            Minimum/Daily/Average Balance </p>
            <p>  Where different interest rates are applicable to "Bands" of the balance, separate sets of field range CR.INT.DATE to CR.INT.AMT are generated for each Band of the Balances on which interest is calculated. </p>
