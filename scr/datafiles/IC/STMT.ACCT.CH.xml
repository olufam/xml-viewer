            <p>This is an internal file containing details of the calculation of account charges for capitalisation (application to the Customer's Account). </p>
            <p>Charges are calculated according to information contained in the COMPANY record.  This may specify that Charges are to be made Monthly, Quarterly or Half Yearly.  If Quarterly is specified, the Quarters begin on the 1st of January, April, July and October. If Half Yearly is specified, these begin on the 1st of January and July. </p>
            <p>Charges are calculated on the value dated balances and account activity statistics stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing. </p>
            <p>The charges are calculated from the date of the last charges capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE CHARGE field), up to the end of the period specified in the COMPANY record. </p>
            <p>Notes: (1) When new Accounts are loaded, the last charge date (CAP            DATE CHARGE) is set to the end of the month in which            they are loaded. No charges are processed automatically            for the first month. </p>
