            <p>This is an internal file containing details of the calculation of Credit 2 Interest for accrual (updating Profit and Loss). </p>
            <p>  Interest is accrued at every monthend (on the day specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL table) and whenever it is capitalised. </p>
            <p>  ACCR.ACCT.CR2 records contain details of credit 2 interest which has been accrued but not yet capitalised (booked to the Customer's Account). At each monthend the interest accrued since the last capitalisation is recalculated, the appropriate Profit and Loss entries are generated and a new ACCR.ACCT.CR2 record is written, replacing the one generated the previous month. When the interest is capitalised, a STMT.ACCT.CR2 record is written and the ACCR.ACCT.CR2 record is deleted. </p>
            <p>  Credit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix CR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT record or GROUP.CREDIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Credit Interest, or on different dates.) </p>
            <p>  Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing. </p>
            <p>  The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Credit 2 Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP.DATE.C2.INT field). </p>
            <p>  The last balance included is the one with Value Date equal to the month end date specified in the MTH.END.UPTO.DAY in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record. The month end accrual calculations are always inclusive of the balance on the month end day. </p>
