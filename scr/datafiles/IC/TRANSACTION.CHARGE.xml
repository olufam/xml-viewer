<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>Transaction charges can be either set up to be calculated when a transaction is booked (CHARGE.PERIOD is set to "T") or when charges </p>
            <p>are capitalised (CHARGE.PERIOD is blank).</p>
            <p>The amount per entry, Free Amount, Minimum Amount and Maximum Amount may be defined for specified Currencies. Default Amounts in local currency equivalent are used for accounts in currencies for which no amounts are specified.</p>
            <p>All Account Maintenance Charges are applied on the charge capitalisation date as specified in CHARGE.CALCULATION on the COMPANY record, (monthly, quarterly, six monthly or annually).</p>
            <p />
            <p>For "T" type charges the parameter records (TRANSACTION, GENERAL.CHARGE and TRANSACTION.CHARGE) relevant to the time of booking will be used. If a parameter record is changed previously booked charges will not be affected. However the REBUILD.TRAN.CHARGES table can be used to trigger a rebuild of transaction charges using the parameter records relevant to the rebuild date.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If transaction charges are set to be calculated at the charge capitalisation date then the parameter records relevant to the charge capitalisation date will apply to all relevant transactions booked during the charge capitalisation period.</p>
            <p />
            <p>For transaction charges to apply to a customer account then 2 conditions must occur:</p>
            <p>The account must be linked to a GENERAL.CHARGE record set for transaction charges. </p>
            <p>TRANSACTION record(s) must set up for transaction charges.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The GENERAL.CHARGE table is linked to an account via GROUP.DEBIT.INT or ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT and is set up for transaction charges as follows:</p>
            <p>TRANS.CODE.CHARGE set to "Y" indicates that transaction charges are to be applied for this general charge type.</p>
            <p>COMB.TRNS.CDE Indicates the transaction charge record used to apply  free, minimum and maximum amounts against transaction charge totals. The PL category for charge postings will be picked up from the relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE record defined here. The PL categories for individual transaction code totals will be blanked on the STMT.ACCT.CH record. </p>
            <p>CHARGE.CODE.LEVEL determines whether all charges are combined or the free minimum and maximum amounts are applied to each major charge type. Setting this to "IND" will apply the free minimum and maximum amounts to the transaction charge total. Setting it to "COM" indicates that Transaction Charges should be combined into one entry with other account maintenance charges, which can include; BALANCE.REQUIREMENT, NUMBER.OF.CREDITS or TURNOVER.CREDIT NUMBER.OF.DEBITS or TURNOVER.DEBIT. </p>
            <p />
            <p>The TRANSACTION table is linked to transaction charges as follows:</p>
            <p>IMMEDIATE.CHARGE has to be set to NO to activate transaction charges.</p>
            <p>CHARGE.KEY links to TRANSACTION.CHARGE via TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF</p>
            <p>for example;</p>
            <p>1 - would link to TRANSACTION.CHARGE record 1 “.” effective date via TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF </p>
            <p>1.2 would link to a TRANSACTION CHARGE record 1 “.” Effective date “.” 2 (where 2 relates to a specific general charge record).</p>
            <p />
            <p>The TRANSACTION.CHARGE.XREF table stores the effective dates relating to TRANSACTION.CHARGE records</p>
            <p>The key contains the sequence number and an optional GENERAL.CHARGE key</p>
            <p>The record contains the effective dates for the charges.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If the GENERAL.CHARGE relevant to the customer account and TRANSACTION relevant to the transaction code in an accounting entry are both set up for transaction charges the relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE record will be determined and if it has the CHARGE.PERIOD set to "T" the transaction charge will be calculated when a transaction is booked. ACCR.ACCT.TRAN.CH will be updated with the charge data. The mimimum maximum and free amounts will not apply to individual charges calculated when a transaction is booked. It is possible to set more than one transaction charge per transaction.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Examples:</p>
            <p>In all cases where records have effective dates in the key the record selected will be the one with the date closest to but not greater than the charge calculation date. </p>
            <p />
            <p>GENERAL.CHARGE 1 and 3 set for transaction charges 2 is not</p>
            <p>TRANS.CODE.CHARGE = "Y"</p>
            <p />
            <p>TRANSACTION 213 set up for transaction charges as follows</p>
            <p>IMMEDIATE.CHARGE = "NO"</p>
            <p>CHARGE.KEY set to 1.2 1.3 1</p>
            <p />
            <p>ACCOUNTS </p>
            <p>12345 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 3.</p>
            <p>23456 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 5.</p>
            <p>45678 linked to GENERAL.CHARGE type 2.</p>
            <p />
            <p>An entry is booked to each account with a transaction code of 213.</p>
            <p>The relevant TRANSACTION.CHARGE records will be as follows</p>
            <p>12345 - 1.YYYYMMDD.3</p>
            <p>23456 - 1.YYYYMMDD</p>
            <p>45678 - no charges apply</p>
            <p />
            <p>Using the above example but TRANSACTION 213 has CHARGE.KEY set to 1.2 1.3 1 2</p>
            <p>2 charges will apply to the transaction from the TRANSACTION.CHARGE records</p>
            <p>12345 - 1.YYYYMMDD.3 and 2.YYYYMMDD</p>
            <p>23456 - 1.YYYYMMDD   and 2.YYYYMMDD</p>
            <p>45678 - no charges apply</p>
