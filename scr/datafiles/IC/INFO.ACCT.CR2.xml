<ovdesc>

            <p>The application INFO.ACCT.CR2 may be used to calculate Credit 2 Interest on-line up to a given date for a specific Account. Function 'V' is used to request the calculation, function 'S' allows the results of calculations to be viewed.</p>
            <p>  When the 'V' function is used - the id should be specified in the format Account number - Capital.date. In the 'S' function the account number can be specified to view the record.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  (Credit 2 Interest is calculated according to rules specified in the fields with prefix CR2 in the appropriate ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT record or GROUP.CREDIT.INT record. It may be Capitalised, i.e. booked to the Customer's Account, on the same dates as normal Credit Interest, or on different dates.)</p>
            <p>  Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the last end of day processing.</p>
            <p>  The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Credit 2 Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE CR2 INT field).</p>
            <p>  The last balance included depends on the LAST DAY INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to the capitalisation date specified, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the capitalisation date specified.</p>
            <p>  Notes :   (1) No bookkeeping entries are generated by this application.               All details contained in this file are for information only.</p>
            <p>  (2) The calculation does not take into account the effect of any               transactions which have not yet taken place but which are               expected to happen before the capitalisation date specified,               (e.g. Standing Orders or regular interest capitalisation),               or any transactions which have been processed since the last               'end of day processing'.</p>
