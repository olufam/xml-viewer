            <p>This is an internal file containing details of the calculation of Debit Interest and Interest Related Charges for capitalisation (application to the Customer's Account). It is used to provide the details on interest statements and advices. </p>
            <p>  The dates and frequency for interest capitalisation are specified for groups of Accounts in the GROUP.CAPITALISATION table or, for specific Accounts, in the ACCT.CAPITALISATION table. The capitalisation is processed during the end of day processing for the capitalisation date specified, or, if this is a non-working day, on the previous working day (except, see note below). </p>
            <p>  Interest is calculated on the value dated balances stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the day of processing. </p>
            <p>  The first balance included in the calculation is the day after the last Debit Interest Capitalisation, as stored in the ACCOUNT record (in the CAP DATE DR INT field). </p>
            <p>  The last balance included depends on the LAST DAY INCLUSIVE field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file, if this contains 'YES', balances are included up to and including the capitalisation date, if it contains 'NO', balances are included only up to the working day prior to the processing date. The date of the last balance included is written to the ACCOUNT record as the new CAP DATE DR INT. Note:           If LAST DAY INCLUSIVE in the                 ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file contains 'YES', and                 the Capitalisation date is on a non-working                 day, before the next working day, and the                 monthend accrual date also falls before the                 next working day and before the                 Capitalisation date, the capitalisation is                 processed on the NEXT working day. </p>

<field>DEF.DR.INT</field>
<desc>
            <p>The deferred amount posted on the deferred date for debit interest.</p>
            <p>For the first correction after posting the deferred amounts the deferred amounts, i.e. the amounts actually posted to the customer account will be used to work out the difference between the original amount and the new calculated amount. Any subsequent corrections will use the previously calculated amount.</p>

<field>CORRECTION.NUMBER</field>
<desc>
            <p>Sequential number of corrected record generated after back-valued entries, rate changes or condition changes. Only present in records which have been corrected. </p>
            <p>  If any entries are processed with VALUE DATES prior to the last Capitalisation date (as stored in the CAP DATE DR INT field in the ACCOUNT record), the COB job IC.BVAL automatically recalculates the interest for the capitalisation period(s) from the one containing the earliest back-valued entry, up to the last Capitalisation date. </p>
            <p>  The new STMT.ACCT.DR record is compared with the one previously calculated, and if there is any difference,  the old one is stored in the CORR.ACCT.DR file, the corrected one is written in this file and appropriate accounting entries are processed for the differences.</p>
            <p>If the correction takes place after deferred interest and charges have been posted then the first correction will use these values to work out the difference, as it is possible to adjust the calculated amount prior to posting either manually or via a back valued posting into the capitalisation period.</p>
            <p>Each time the same capitalisation is corrected, the correction number is incremented by 1. </p>
            <p>  When interest rates or conditions are amended, back-value recalculations are not processed automatically, but can be requested via the table TABLE CAPITALIS CORR. </p>
