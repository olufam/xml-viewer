            <p>The purpose of this table is to request recalculation and correction of previously applied interest. </p>
            <p>The system automatically recalculates and corrects interest when entries with Value Dates prior to the last interest application are processed, but does not automatically recognise back-valued changes to interest rates or conditions. </p>
            <p>It is possible to request corrections for all Accounts, specific Accounts or selected Groups of Accounts.  In each case, the date from which the recalculation should start must be specified. </p>
            <p>Corrections are calculated up to each Capitalisation Date between the recalculation start date specified and the last Capitalisation Date.  Correction entries are generated with the correct Value Date for each Capitalisation period and taken into account in the recalculation of subsequent periods. </p>
            <p>Both automatic and requested recalculations and correction entries are processed during the end of day run by the program EOD.CAPITALIS.CORR. </p>
