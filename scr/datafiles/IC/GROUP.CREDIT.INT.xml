<ovdesc>

            <p>The Group Credit Interest Table allows the specification of a calculation method for credit interest for groups of accounts.  Account groups are determined automatically on the basis of Customer and Account details such as Residence, Sector, Account Category and Currency.  At the time of Account input, reference is made to General Condition and Condition Priority tables.  From these a General Condition code is derived for later access to the Group Credit Interest table.  (For further information, see the General Condition and Condition Priority tables.)</p>
            <p>   - Interest can be calculated on a Daily, Average or Minimum balance          basis using value dated balances.</p>
            <p>   - Rates can be fixed or linked to Basic Rates plus or minus a          Margin.</p>
            <p>   - Different rates can be specified for different balance levels and          may be linked to the same or different basic rates.  The rates          may apply to the whole of the balance or to the part between two          balance levels.</p>
            <p>   Where special credit interest conditions apply to a specific account, reference should be made to the ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT table.</p>

<field>CR.CALCUL.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Determines whether the interest calculation will be performed up to the credit balance Level or in Bands (where the interest calculation employed is dependent upon the size of credit balance).</p>
            <p>   If more than one set of fields CR.BASIC.RATE to CR.LIMIT.AMT are input, this indicates that a different interest rate is applicable depending on the size of the credit balance.  CR CALCUL TYPE specifies whether separate calculations are to be made for each Band of the credit balance or one is to be made on the entire balance, dependent on the Level of the balance.</p>
            <p>   Example:</p>
            <p>   Assume a credit balance of 15,000 and a Group Credit Interest record which specifies an applicable rate of 10 per cent up to 10,000 and 15 per cent above 10,000.</p>
            <p>   If Band is specified, 2 calculations will be performed, i.e.</p>
            <p>   10 per cent on 10,000                 15 per cent on  5,000</p>
            <p>   If Level is specified, 1 calculation will be performed, i.e.</p>
            <p>   15 per cent on 15,000.</p>

            <p>   If a range of days is set then the interest over the accrue period will be calculated on a month to month basis rather than on the entire accrual period.</p>

            <p>A setting of Yes indicates that credit interest amounts below the minimum value, specified in CR.MIN.VALUE, are to be waived. If HIST options are selected then during correction the system uses the mid reval rate on correction period end to convert the minimum amount</p>

            <p>Identifies either a Tax record (defined in TAX table) or Tax.Type.Condition record with a "*" symbol prefixed to a valid tax.type.condition which specifies the calculation and processing of tax, applicable to credit interest. If tax rate is given then tax is calculated on the associated group of accounts. If a Tax Type Condition Identifier is specified, the system will derive the applicable TAX.CODE from the TAX.TYPE.CONDITION based on the customer grouping. (tax.type.condition allows to define different tax rates for different tax.gen.condition records). Input of tax.type.condition helps in deducting different rates of tax for different group of customers in the associated group of accounts.</p>
