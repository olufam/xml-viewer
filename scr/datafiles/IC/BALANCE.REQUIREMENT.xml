<table>BALANCE.REQUIREMENT</table>
</header>
<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The purpose of this table is to define a fixed Account charge to be applied if a specified Balance is not maintained. </p>
            <p>The General Charge record, referred to in the relevant Group or ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT record, specifies whether or not this charge is applicable to an Account. </p>
            <p>A range of charges for different Balances may be specified. </p>
            <p>The required Balance may be defined as the Minimum or Average Balance over a given period. </p>
            <p>The charge is applied monthly, quarterly or six monthly as specified in the Company record.  The General Charge record specifies whether the calculation is in one step, covering the balances over the whole period, or in monthly steps, applying the appropriate charge for each month during which the required Balance is not maintained. </p>
            <p>The Balance Requirement record which is in effect on the date of the charges capitalisation defines the calculation rules for the whole capitalisation period. </p>

<field>CURRENCY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the Currency for which the Balance Requirement Charge details in the associated Sub-fields 11-12 apply.  For Accounts in Currencies with no input in this Field, the Default Amounts specified in Fields 8-9 are used. </p>
            <p>This multivalue field is to be used to record all Currencies for which specific Balance Requirement charges are to be made.  Where a balance Requirement charge is based on the Currency equivalent of the local value charge, only Fields 8 and 9 should be completed. </p>

            <p>The month may be 01-12 or 1-12. </p>
            <p>It is always displayed formatted YYYY-MM.  For new input the date may not be earlier than today. </p>
            <p>The Balance Requirement record which is in effect on the date of the charges capitalisation defines the calculation rules for the whole capitalisation period. </p>
