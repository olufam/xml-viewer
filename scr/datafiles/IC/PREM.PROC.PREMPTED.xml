            <p>Premium processing is usually initiated for an account based on the capitalisation frequency specified on the SAVINGS.PREMIUM file. This can be prempted and a capitalisation frequency can be specified on the account record itself. This creates the need for maintaining a list of premium types for accounts and the dates on which the capitalisation has been specified for them to occur. This file will hold all of this information on its 'key' field. Additionally 4 I-Descriptors will need to be created to hold the information held in the key field, each pertaining to a component of the key. </p>
