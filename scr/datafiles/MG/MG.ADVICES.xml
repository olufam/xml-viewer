            <p>This file controls which activities will produce delivery output and the format of that output for different categories of contract. </p>
            <p>This control is made at category code level.  Therefore, separate records defining the output required, and, the format of that output may be entered for each category used within the mortgage module. </p>
            <p>However, the output format required for some categories will be the same as for others. Therefore this file allows a given category to use the format definitions of a second category. This eliminates the need to duplicate format details for similar categories of contract. </p>

        <p>Identifies the activity codes for which delivery output is required for the category code in question. This field defines which activities defined on the MG.ACTIVITY table are to produce delivery output for the category code in question. If all activities are to produce output, or, if no output is required this can be indicated by entering "ALL" or "NONE" respectively. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1 - 7 alphanumeric characters either "ALL", "NONE" or a seven numeric activity code. (mandatory input) If "ALL" then there can be no other input to this field. If "NONE" is entered then there can be no other input to this field. Duplicate activity codes are not allowe.</p>
        <p>CATEGORY</p>
        <p>Identifies the category code to which the record applies. This field identifies the category code whose delivery output is controlled by this record. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 5 numeric characters. (mandatory input) Must be a valid category code on the CATEGORY table. Must be a valid mortgage category code as defined on the MG.PARAMETER table.</p>
        <p>FORMAT.CATEGORY</p>
        <p>Specifies which category code is to be used for formating of delivery output. The format of delivery output is controlled by the DE.FORMAT.PRINT file. The key to the DE.FORMAT.PRINT record that is to be used for formatting an advice is constructed from the relevant activity code and the category code of the contract. This means that a different format record may be defined for each category code for any given activity. It is however unlikely that this degree of flexibility is required. Therefore, this field allows a given category to refer to another category for the purpose of formatting delivery output. Example: ID : 25007 FORMAT CATEGORY : 25000 In this case all delivery output for category 25007 will be formatted using the DE.FORMAT.PRINT records for category 25000. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 5 numeric characters (mandatory input) Must be a valid category on the CATEGORY table. Must be a valid mortgage category code as defined on the MG.PARAMETER table. Must be of the same mortgage product type as defined by the MG.PARAMETER table.</p>

            <p>If "ALL" then there can be no other input to this field.</p>

            <p>       In this case all delivery output for category 25007 will be        formatted using the DE.FORMAT.PRINT records for category 25000. </p>
