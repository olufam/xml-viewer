            <p>This table contains all the Local Stock Exchange Commissions and Fees as payable on the GERMAN stock exchange. </p>
            <p>It contains standard default Category and Transaction codes for all P &amp; L related entries as well as the various bands at which different percentages are to be applied and the asset type to which those rates refer. </p>
            <p>Additionally, it allows the user to store whenever possible the minimum charges payable within that specified stock exchange.  It must be pointed out that whereas the system is completely flexible regarding the different levels and rates applicable - a change in the fundamental calculation process would inevitably lead to a program change. </p>
