            <p>If the position concerned is for a security then this field will contain the gross cost price for a single security expressed in the security currency of the security (which will be the security in the associated SECURITY.CCY field). It is calculated using the GROSS.COST.SEC.CCY field from the SECURITY.POSITION record represented by this set of values. It is calculated as follows ; </p>
            <p>GROSS.COST = (COST.INVST * PERC.FACTOR) / (NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR) Where COST.INVST is the value contained in the GROSS.COST.SEC.CCY field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). NOMINAL is the closing nominal balance found from the SECURITY.POSITION record field CLOSING.BAL.NO.NOM. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the gross cost price is pro-rated. </p>

            <p>If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.POS.ASSET file. It is calculated as follows ; </p>
            <p>COST.PRICE = (COST.INVST * PERC.FACTOR) / (NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR) </p>
            <p>Where COST.INVST is the value contained in the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). NOMINAL is the closing nominal balance fould from the SECURITY.POSITION record field CLOSING.BAL.NO.NOM. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated. </p>
            <p>If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract.
