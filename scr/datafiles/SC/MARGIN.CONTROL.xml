            <p />
            <p>Is a table used at SECURITY.MASTER level to assign a collateral value rate to a particular asset. </p>
            <p>This rate is then used within the customer's valuations to ascertain the "Collateral Value", as opposed to the "Market Valuation" of a portfolio. </p>
            <p>As with all valuations, the reference currency of the particular client is used. </p>

            <p>It is envisaged for example that an ID of say 75 indicates to the user and the system that approx.75% of the market estimation of the holding in a given security is sufficient "Collateral" for lending purposes.  On a client's "Margin Valuation" this estimation will be displayed against the market estimation for comparison purposes. It will be further evaluated at the summary page, where an internal limit can be entered and available or excess funds illustrated. </p>
