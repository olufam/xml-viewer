<field>V.DATE.COST</field>
<desc>
            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position. This field will contain the cost of the position. The actual calculation done for this field will depend on the type of position this set of values represents.</p>
            <p>     The value of this field is calculated in a similar way to the COST.PRICE field but using value dated positions.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the VALUE.DATED.COST field from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.POS.ASSET file. It is calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p>     COST.PRICE = (VD.COST * PERC.FACTOR) / (VD.NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR)</p>
            <p>     Where VD.COST is the value contained in the VALUE.DATED.COST       field on the SECURITY.POSITION record.       PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in       percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record       associated with the security) and 1 otherwise.       MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security       (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the       security).       VD.NOMINAL is the value dated nominal balance found from the       SECURITY.POSITION record field VALUE.DATED.POSN. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract. It is retained as the cost price until the contact matures and is removed from the portfolio valuation.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Forward Rate Agreement then this field will contain the value in the INTEREST.RATE field of the original contract.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for an Account then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Money Market contract or for a Loans and Deposits contract then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Fiduciary contract then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Miscellaneous Deal then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Derivative contract then this field contains the cost for Value dated positions. The Cost price is calculated the same way as COST.PRICE but only for value dated positions. For options with premium paid up front</p>

            <p>     If the position is for a Foreign Exchange (FX) contract then this field will either contain either the bought or sold currency from the FOREX contract, from either the CURRRENCY.BOUGHT or CURRENCY.SOLD fields. When a Forex contract is recorded on the T24 Portfolio management system then the bought and sold sides are recorded separately. This is because the value of the contract to the portfolio depends on the exchange rates of the individual currencies on the deal against the reference currency of the portfolio at the time of the contract and at the time of rebuilding the portfolio valuation data. The value is then the difference (i.e. revaluation using the rebate method).</p>

<field>COST.PRICE</field>

            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position. This field will contain the cost of the position. The actual calculation done for this field will depend on the type of position this set of values represents.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.POS.ASSET file. It is calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p>     COST.PRICE = (COST.INVST * PERC.FACTOR) / (NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR)</p>
            <p>     Where COST.INVST is the value contained in the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). NOMINAL is the closing nominal balance fould from the SECURITY.POSITION record field CLOSING.BAL.NO.NOM. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract. It is retained as the cost price until the contact matures and is removed from the portfolio valuation.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Forward Rate Agreement then this field will contain the value in the INTEREST.RATE field of the original contract.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for an Account then this field will be blank.</p>

            <p>     For derivatives it has three parametric set up given detailed below.</p>
            <p>Positional</p>
            <p> Futures - Cost price is the weighted average of all the buy and sell price taken together </p>
            <p> Options - when PREM.POST.TIME is 'TRADE' cost price is the weighted average of all buy prices alone if the buy lots are more than the sell lots, else weighted average of all sell prices if the sell lots are more than BUY lots. in case PREM.POST.TIME is 'SETTLEMENT' it will behave as future contract</p>
            <p />
            <p>BUY.SELL.POS</p>
            <p> Cost price is multi-value field with the weighted average of all buy transactions as one and  weighted average of all sell transactions as another field</p>
            <p />
            <p>Transactional</p>
            <p>Cost price will be shown transaction wise for each transaction as a multi-value field. Here for each transaction, cost price will be same as the price.</p>

            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position.</p>
            <p>     This field is the value dated margin value of the position. If the position is a debit or a short position then this field will be equal to the associated V.DT.ESTIMATION field. Otherwise this field will contain a value calculated by multiplying the V.DT.ESTIMATION amount by the Margin Rate for the position.</p>
            <p>     For all positions other than Securities (SC) and Fiduciaries (FD) then the Margin Rate will come from the MARGIN.RATE field in the ASSET.BY.CATEG record for the CATEGORY of the position - if there is one - and then default to the MARGIN.RATE field on the ASSET.TYPE record the position is linked to if there is no ASSET.BY.CATEG record. If the margin rate has not been entered on either of these files a rate os 0 is used.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Fiduciary (FD) contract then the system will first try to find the margin rate from the ASSET.BY.CATEG file, then use the MARGIN.RATE field on the FD.FID.ORDER record before finally using the ASSET.TYPE record if a margin rate has not been set-up on either of the other files.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Securities (SC) contract then the system will first see if there is a MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the SECURITY.MASTER record for the Security. If there is the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.CONTROL record. If there is no MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the Security then the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.RATE field of the SUB.ASSET.TYPE record the position is connected to.</p>
            <p>     If the position is for a Derivatives (DX) contract then this field contains the variation margin amount for value-dated positions.</p>

            <p>     This field is only updated if the position is for an Account. The value dated account balance (contained in the V.DATE.NOMINAL field) is taken from the ONLINE.ACTUAL.BAL field on the ACCOUNT file. The trade dated account balance (held in the NO.NOMINAL field) includes any accounting movements resulting from the Securities module except dividends and coupons that have not yet reached Ex-Div Date. This is because the Securities movements these accounting movements relate to will be included in the portfolio valuation as a trade dated security position. Thus this field contains the difference between the NO.NOMINAL and V.DATE.NOMINAL fields for an Account position.</p>
