            <p>OVERVIEW OF REDEMPTION CUS </p>
            <p>The 'REDEMPTION.CUS' record is automatically generated by T24 using the information contained within the authorised 'REDEMPTION.DET' application. </p>
            <p>Whereas the detail record contains all the common information relating to a particular redemption i.e. partial or final, redemption price, one particular depository, or all; the customer record is a unique record per customer per depository and you can therefore have many customer records for one detail record.  The system calculates the gross redemption proceeds less any foreign and/or any local charges to arrive at the redemption the system will reduce all clients' holdings in proportion to the nominal redeemed. </p>
            <p>Each customer record is given an unique transaction record.  Once the transaction is authorised positions are updated and financial entries posted. </p>

<field>DELIVERY.KEY</field>
<desc>
            <p>A number Generated automatically by the system after authorisation which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a transaction. After validation but before authorisation, the value 'VAL' will be inserted in this field to indicate that the transaction has been validated successfully but is still waiting authorisation. </p>
            <p>After authorisation of a Funds Transfer transaction, the system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields. The following examples will illustrate the use of this field. </p>
            <p>Example 1: </p>
            <p>On the execution date of a transaction there will normally be an entry on a Customer account and the following type of number will be generated at this field: </p>
            <p>           92.1  STMT.NO  673732684.48            92.2  STMT.NO  1 </p>
            <p>The number automatically generated in field 92.1 is unique to the transaction in question and is built in the following way: </p>
            <p>1.         The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days            since the 1st of January 1968. In our example, it            corresponds to the 11th of June 1986. </p>
            <p>2.         The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of            seconds since midnight. In our example, it corresponds            to an entry generated on line at 09:04:44 AM. </p>
            <p>3.         The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds            of seconds. </p>
            <p>The value assigned (again automatically) to field 92.2 identifies the number in 92.1 as a statement entry number. If the User wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen the User will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and the type the following at 'Awaiting ID' :- </p>
            <p>                673732684.480001 </p>
            <p>where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first statement entry (there will normally be more than one as the next example will illustrate). </p>
            <p>Example 2: </p>
            <p>A second example outlined here is similar to that in example 1, in that there is a statement entry on value date for both the our account and the customer account. The system handles this case as follows: </p>
            <p>                92.1  STMT.NO  673732684.48                 92.2  STMT.NO  1-2 </p>
            <p>Once again field 92.1 contains the identification number automatically generated by the system while field 92.2 now contains two separate numbers signifying that there are infact two separate statement entries, one in respect of the our account pay and one in respect of the our account receive. If the User wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at 'Awaiting ID' type EITHER: </p>
            <p>                673732684.480001 </p>
            <p>where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the statement entry in respect of the our account OR </p>
            <p>                673732684.480002 </p>
            <p>where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the statement entry in respect of the customer account. </p>
            <p>Example 3: </p>
            <p>A third example might be that of a category entry generated at initiation of a transaction where commission or charges have been debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss category code. In this case the following entries are generated on the transaction: </p>
            <p>                92.1  STMT.NO  673732684.48                 92.3  STMT.NO  1 </p>
            <p>Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at field 92.1 </p>
            <p>Now, however, field 92.2 is replaced by field 92.3 which now identifies the number in 92.1 as a category entry and not a statement entry. </p>
            <p>To call this category entry record onto the screen the User must now type: </p>
            <p>           CATEG.ENTRY at 'Awaiting Application' </p>
            <p>followed by: </p>
            <p>           673732684.480001 at 'Awaiting ID'. </p>
