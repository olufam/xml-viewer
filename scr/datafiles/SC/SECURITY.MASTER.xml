<field>INTEREST.DAY.BASIS</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the method of calculation for accrued interest on a Security be it a Bond, Gilt, Loan stock etc</p>
            <p>Example: A = 360/360 where a standard 30 day month is assumed over 360 days a year, as is the case for all Eurobond calculations.</p>
            <p>Note that O and U values are intended to enable the setting-up of French Oat and US Treasury Bills respectively.</p>
            <p>For US Treasury (value = U), the number of days in the denominator vary according to the number of days in the interest period. For example, if the number of days in the interest period is 182 and the number of payments in a year is 2, then the denominator (i.e. basis days) would be 364. Similarly, if number of days in a interest period is 184, the base days would be 368.</p>
            <p />
            <p>For a basic fixed interest French Oat (value = O) and also for French BTAN issues, the process requires rounding within the calculation to the nearest THIRD decimal (0.0005 is rounded up)</p>
            <p>For example :</p>
            <p>An investor holds 10 000 securities of the 5.25%, 25 April 2008, OAT.</p>
            <p>Full coupon per security: 0.05250 payable on 25 April 2000</p>
            <p>Accrued interest calculation date: 24 March 2000</p>
            <p>Number of days accrued: 334</p>
            <p>Total number of days in the interest period: 366 (the O is actually hard-coded as ACT/ACT basis)</p>
            <p>Calculation :</p>
            <p>5.25 * 334 / 366 = 4.790834 rounded to 3 decimals = 4.791</p>
            <p>Therefore :</p>
            <p>Accrued interest in percentage: 4.791%</p>
            <p>Total amount of accrued interest paid in euro: 479.10</p>
            <p>NOTE :</p>
            <p>Please refer to the BOND.ROUNDING field on this file, the two files UNIT.INT.METHOD and BOND.ROUNDING to enable greater control over rounding of interest. Your User Guide explains the processes in greater detail to help you decide.</p>

This rate will be used to calculate that portion of the coupon interest that will not be paid out to the customer and instead will be capitalised to the principal amount. As a result of the capitalisation the factor on the bond will increase and hence the value of the nominal holding will increase in turn. The factor in this case will be calculated using the following formula :</p>
