            <p>This table is user defined and particular to the Securities' Module only. </p>
            <p>It allows the user to set up his own codes for each and every transaction within the Securities Module.  The ID for each of these transactions is a 1-3 alpha/numeric code which the user sets up when implementing the system initially.  Examples of these codes are:-"SPR" for all security purchase type transactions;" DIV" for all Dividend payments etc. </p>
            <p>This table is linked to two other tables within the Securities area:- </p>
            <p>SC.TRANS.TYPE and Transaction (Which is a table type file in common with all other T24 Modules. </p>
            <p>The SC.TRANS.TYPE file takes the transaction name and links it to both a Securities Credit or Debit Indicator and then specifies whether or not that Entry is a financial Credit or Debit (by using a valid transaction code.) </p>
            <p>The purpose of these tables is to enable the system to identify the type of transaction being entered and how to post entries.  An extra feature is that it allows the user to define and manipulate his own transaction codes. </p>
