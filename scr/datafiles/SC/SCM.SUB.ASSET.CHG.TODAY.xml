            <p>This file is intended to provide a quick view of any SECURITY.MASTER records having had their respective SUB.ASSET.TYPEs modeified during the course of the current on-line day. </p>
            <p>NOTE that when a SUB.ASSET.TYPE is changed on a SECURITY.MASTER file, you are prompted to specify whether or not you wish valuation data (in this case, the SC.POS.ASSET file) updated either on-line or during the end-of-day batch stage. </p>
            <p>If you specify "on-line" then the updates occur straightaway. If you specify that you wish the updates to take place during the EOD, then the changes are stored on this file. </p>
            <p>This file is always cleared after use by the EOD batch. </p>
