            <p>This is a table type program which is user maintained and records details of tax codes to be levied on any particular Dividend/Interest payment. To effect this payment correctly the user must know the rates of tax applicable within any one individual country. Those rates are stored within the tax file by the tax code entered. </p>
            <p>Whenever the System processes an Interest/Dividend payment it reads the domicile of the security concerned to enable it to calculate the 'source' tax which is to be deducted from the gross payment to any individual client. </p>
            <p>Also within this file the user can store 'Local' tax codes to be levied from any payment. </p>
            <p>Both Source and Local tax amounts are recorded as statement as opposed to category entries within T24 to reflect the correct position regarding any tax liabilities. </p>
            <p>Additionally within this file there is allowance for different rates per equities/Bonds. </p>
