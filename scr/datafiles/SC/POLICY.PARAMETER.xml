            <p />
            <p>A user of T24 has the facility using this file to set up parameters relating to a banks' holding in various assets. </p>
            <p>He can, for example indicate that the banks' policy for U.S. dollar equities is to hold no more than 50% in the total for all security portfolio's. </p>
            <p>Periodically he will obtain a print out of the details relating to that particular holding by customer, in the form of an investment policy comparison where the policy plan would be displayed against the actual percentage holding.  The user can also input a variance ratio of say 5% and get a periodic warning list of each position which then differs from the policy plan. </p>
