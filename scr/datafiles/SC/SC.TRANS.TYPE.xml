<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>This table is user defined and particular to the Securities' Module only. </p>
            <p>It allows the user to set up his own codes for each and every transaction within the Securities Module.  The ID for each of these transactions is a 1-3 alpha/numeric code which the user sets up when implementing the system initially.  Examples of these codes are:-"SPS" for all security Buy/Sell type transactions;" DIV" for all Dividend payments etc. </p>
            <p>This table is linked to two other tables within the Securities area:- </p>
            <p>SC.TRANS.NAME and Transaction (Which is a table type file in common with all other T24 Modules. </p>
            <p>The SC.TRANS.TYPE file takes the transaction name and links it to both a Securities Credit or Debit Indicator and then specifies whether or not that Entry is a financial Credit or Debit (by using a valid transaction code.) </p>
            <p>The purpose of these tables is to enable the system to identify the type of transaction being entered and how to post entries.  An extra feature is that it allows the user to define and manipulate his own transaction codes. </p>

            <p>A user defined code for each and every transaction within the Securities Module which are linked to two additional table type files.             (i) SC.TRANS.NAME.            (ii) Transactions. </p>
            <p>Together they enable the system to process all sorts of transactions correctly. </p>
            <p>A Securities Trade for example would contain two SC.TRANS.NAME Codes linked within the SC.TRANS.TYPE file.  A purchase for the client would be "SPR" and a Sale by the Broker "SSL".  As mentioned these would be linked within the SC.TRANS.TYPE file under an ID of say"SPS" and it is at this stage that the user would specify which of these codes was a securities Credit type transaction and what financial entry was to be entered against that code. </p>
            <p>Examples:  A Securities' Trade would be given an SC.TRANS.TYPE            ID of "SPS". </p>

            <p> The Maximum value is specified in EB.OBJECT for TRANSACTION. </p>
