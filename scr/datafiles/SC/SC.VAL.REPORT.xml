<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>This table is user maintained and is used to produce the valuation reports as defined by the user, using the Enquiries System. </p>
            <p>This table will only be used if the Valuation Subroutine on the SC.PARAMETER record is "SC.VAL.REPORT$RUN. </p>
            <p>This means that when the user decides to use this file to produce the reports, the following steps need to be carried out to ensure that fatal errors will not occur. </p>
            <p>1.         This table must be set up with all the enquiry record            layouts required for each report type. </p>
            <p>2.         The SC.PARAMETER record must be updated as shown            above. </p>
            <p>3.         There are three applications which can be used to            produce the reports:- </p>
            <p>           (i)  Outline reports (OL.VAL.REPS).  The user must                 amend records here to validate the report type                 against SC.VAL.REPORT </p>
            <p>           (ii) End of Day (SC.REPORTS.REQUEST)                 Same changes to be made by the user as for                 OL.VAL.REPS. </p>
            <p>           (iii)CUSTOMER SECURITY records to be updated so                 that these report types are validated against                 SC.VAL.REPORT. </p>
            <p>To avoid unnecessary errors it is advisable to create the same records which are held on the SC.REPORT.TYPE file and therefore, avoiding the above changes to the database apart from the SC.PARAMETER record. </p>
            <p>A number of Enquiries are provided to the user which may be of help in creating your own.  These are:- </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.REPORT            Transaction details showing nominal                          amout, price and estimation amount. </p>
            <p>SC.PORT.TOTALS           Portfolio totals showing contributions,                          withdrawals, accrued interests etc. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.EQ.COUNTRY        Equities summary by country. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.EQ.INDUSTRY       Equities summary by industry. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.FIXED.SEC.MAT     Fixed term securities by maturity. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.ANNUALISE         Annualised performance analysis. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.LIQUIDITY.MAT     Liquidates by maturity. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.SAM.HEAD          Header page showing static details of                          the portfolio i.e. name and address. </p>
            <p>SC.VAL.MATRIX            Valuations matrix grid. </p>
            <p>The example below shows a SC.VAL.REPORT record created using above enquiries:- </p>
            <p>3          DETAIL.HEADER SC.VAL.SAM.HEAD 4.1        ASSET.TYPE 30 _ BONDS 5.1        SUB.ASSET.TYPE 6.1        DETAIL.LAYOUT SC.VAL.REPORT 7.1        DET.PAGE.THROW NO 4.2        ASSET.TYPE 10 _ SHARES 5.2        SUB.ASSET.TYPE 6.2        DETAIL.LAYOUT SC.VAL.REPORT 7.2        DET.PAGE.THROW Y 8          DEF.DET.LAYOUT SC.VAL.REPORT 9          SUMMARY.HEADER 10.1       SUMMARY.LAYOUT SC.PORT.TOTALS 11.1       SUM.PAGE.THROW Y 10.2       SUMMARY.LAYOUT SC.VAL.ANNUALISE 11.2       SUM.PAGE.THROW NO </p>
            <p>This will produce the report by grouping the asset types 30 and 10 on the different pages of the report and the rest together using the same layout SC.VAL.REPORT and two summary reports. </p>
