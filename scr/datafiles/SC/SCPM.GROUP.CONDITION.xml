            <p>SCPM.GROUP.CONDITION </p>
            <p> PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT GROUP CONDITIONS </p>
            <p> This module defines the specific charge details for each customer group.</p>
            <p>ID format for the group condition can be "NNN.DDMMYYYY" ,"C-NNNNNN.DDMMYYYY" or "P-NNNNNN-N.DDMMYYYY" where NNNNNN is the customer ID and NNNNNN-N denotes the portfolio ID and DDMMYYYY represent date </p>
            <p>On authorization of the customer level record, the ID (C-NNNNNN) will update the ACTUAL.GROUP in CUSTOMER.CHARGE to be used as the default condition for the charge type.</p>
            <p>If a Portfolio level record exists, the ACTUAL.GROUP (for the portfolio) in CUSTOMER.CHARGE, for the charge type, will be updated with the portfolio record ID.</p>
            <p>  The following data will be recorded on this file:- </p>
            <p>       Calculation Method                "DETAIL" or "TOTAL" </p>

            <p>       When Management fees are processed, each security in the portfolio is processed in turn.  There are two possible ways of calculating the total commission for the portfolio. </p>
            <p>       The table below shows how the two methods work and the different results achieved: </p>

            <p>       Method 1 </p>
            <p>       This is to take the total "TOTAL 1" as the total charge amount for the portfolio.  In this way different commission codes can be used and the band and level processing be applied for each security. </p>
            <p>       Method 2 </p>
            <p>       This is to take the total "TOTAL 2" and then apply the TOT.COMMISSION.CODE and percentage to that total.  In this way only one FT.COMMISSION.TYPE is applied to the total base amount for the portfolio. </p>
            <p>       The use of either method 1 or 2 will be controlled at level of each charge condition record. </p>
            <p>       Therefore if the calculation Method is "DETAIL" then Method 1 is used and for "TOTAL" Method 2 is used. </p>
            <p>       Finally the total Commission the GLOBAL.CODE if required needs to be applied. </p>
            <p>       If say the total fees was 129.5 and the global code takes 90% of the total fees then the final fees to be applied to the customer is 116.55 plus the depository charges. </p>

<field>MIN.AMOUNT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the minimum advisory charge amount in the associated MIN.MAX.CCY.</p>
            <p> When the Advisory charges are calculated, less any discount amount, a minimum and maximum value can be specified. This value can be specified in any currency.</p>
            <p> The system will first attempt to determine if the min/max is specified in the currency of the account that the charge (field ACCOUNT.CCY in the file SC.ADVISORY.CHG) will be posted to, if not found the value defined for the DEF.MIN.MAX.CCY will be used and converted at mid rate to the account currency.</p>
            <p> For non DAILY accruals this value represents the minimum amount to be charged to the customer for the charge period. For DAILY accruals this value represents the minimum annual charge and so will be adjusted in relation to the charge period length, for example $1000 will be adjusted to $250 for a quarterly charge period.</p>

            <p>       This field will be used to determine the method for calculating the management fees charges: </p>
            <p>       i.e.  If "TOTAL" then a total base amount for the portfolio's holdings will be used to calculate the fees.  If "DETAIL" then for each "SEC.TYPE", individual fees will be calculated for each portfolio, based on the base amount for each security and then accumulated to determine the total charge. </p>

<field>CALC.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Multi-valued field associated with all the field down to DELIV.END to form a group of fields that indicate the dates to be used in calculating the portfolio advisory charges for portfolios connected with this charging group. </p>
            <p>       This field along with its associated multi-valued fields allow the user to specify the different date ranges for the four different types of date range that can occur when calculating Management Fees. </p>
            <p>       These four ranges are; PERIODIC.OPEN   Used when the Charges run is an automatic                 charging run controlled by the ADVISORY.FREQ field                 on the SEC.ACC.MASTER record for the portfolio and                 this is the first automatic run for the portfolio. PERIODIC.NORMAL Used when the charges run is an automatic charging                 controlled by the ADVISORY.FREQ field on the                 SEC.ACC.MASTER record for the portfolio and the                 portfolio has previously had Advisory Fees                 calculated for it. CLOSURE.NORMAL  Used when the fees are being calculated because                 a portfolio is being closed and the portfolio has                 previously had Advisory Fees calculated on it. CLOSURE.OPEN    Used when the fees are being calculated because                 a portfolio is being closed and the portfolio has                 never had Advisory Fees calculated on it. </p>

<field>DEF.MIN.MAX.CCY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the currency code that will contain the default minimum / maximum values for advisory charges.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     If the system cannot find a definition in the currency in which the charges are calculated, the definitions for this currency will be taken and will be converted at mid-rate to the charge account currency.</p>

<field>DELIV.END</field>
<desc>
            <p>Field allowing the user to specify the end date printed on any delivery produced by fees charged for the period type defined in the associated CALC.TYPE field. </p>
            <p>       This is done using the characters -,+,L,C and O together with numeric input where; O represents the date of the portfolio opening. L represents the date of the Last Fees Run. C represents todays system date. </p>
            <p>       Thus C-1 is the calendar date before today.      O+1 is the calendar date after the opening date of the          portfolio. </p>
