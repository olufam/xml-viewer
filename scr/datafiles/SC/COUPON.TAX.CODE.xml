            <p>The Coupon Tax Code is a simple table type file contained within the static information area of the Securities/Portfolio Module. It is used to contain details relating to whether tax is to be levied from an Interest, Dividend, Coupon payment. </p>
            <p>When setting up a Security Master record, COUPON.TAX.CODE is a mandatory input field and the ID must exist on this table. </p>
            <p>When TAX.TO.BE.PAID is set to yes the System will read the appropriate Country record to establish the correct percentage of tax to be levied and the corresponding category code to which the tax should be levied. </p>
