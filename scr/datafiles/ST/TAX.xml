<overview>
<ovdesc>
<p>The purpose of this table is to define in a central place and by means of keys all the various Tax Rates which could be applicable in your bank on any type of transaction that the Customer is doing with you or which will apply on interest paid to or received from the Customer. The Tax Rate defined for each key will then determine the amount of Tax to be added to or subtracted from the amount to be given or received by the Customer. </p><p>In its present version, the Tax Rate will always be applied in a "FLAT" way, i.e. tax calculations which are based on a "TIME" factor are not presently available. </p><p>It is also possible to indicate whether tax is to be credited to the tax account in local currency or in the currency of the deal on which it is being applied.  If this field is left blank then tax will be credited in the currency in which it is calculated. All currency conversion will use the mid rate applicable at the time of the calculation. </p><p>Tax debited to the customer will still be posted in the currency in which it is calculated,  it is only the credit to the tax account which will be posted in local cuurency. </p></ovdesc>
