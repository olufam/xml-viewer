<overview>
<ovdesc>
<p>This table defines the conditions relating to all types of Commission used in applications.</p><p>     Each Commission Type can be defined as a Flat Amount or as one which varies according to the amount transferred.  In this latter case different Percentages can be defined for different Bands or Levels of transfer amounts.  Minimum and maximum Commissions can be specified for each Band or Level together with overall minimum or maximum commission charges. </p><p>     Commissions in local currency must be entered and special foreign currency Commissions can also be defined if required. </p><p>     The entire commission can be waived depending on whether the ordering customer is resident or non-resident within certain countries. </p><p>     In addition COMMISSION.TYPES can be linked to allow different commission structures, tax codes etc to be applied depending on the residence of the ordering customer. For example commissions can be defined for EEC and NON-EEC resident customers. </p><p>     The Currency codes specified in this table in association with the percentage or the amount of charges will always refer to the Currency of the transfer, i.e. the debit Currency for the inward payments and the credit Currency for all other types of payment.  As a minimum, the local Currency must be specified and any Currency which has not been defined will then default to these conditions and create the appropriate equivalent amount using the rates held on the Currency file. </p></ovdesc>
