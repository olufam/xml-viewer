<overview>
<ovdesc>
<p>This is a Type "W" file that is used to poupulate the file F.INT.MOVEMENT based on the contents of the Parameter file, INT.MOVEMENT.PARAM. This is essentially to be used as a conversion program to extract the details of Interest and Tax entries generated within the database until the Interest and Tax entries are extracted automatically by the Accounting module. The "Verify" function is used to start the extraction of Interest and Tax entries. Any discrepancies found during the extract process (like Account not found in both live and History file etc) will be logged in the file EXCEPTION.LOG so that they can be corrected manually if required. </p></ovdesc>
