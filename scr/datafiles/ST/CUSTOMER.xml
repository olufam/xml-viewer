<p>The Customer Application contains all the basic information about any "Customer" which the bank has dealings with.  In this sense, a Customer base record will be opened for correspondent banks, brokers, guarantors etc. as well as for current and savings account holders.</p><p /><p>Ideally only one Customer base record should exist for each Customer, this can be whenever a name and address is obtained and is not dependent on the existence of an account.  For example, a Customer base record can be set up for a Customer with whom the Bank only expects to have Money Market or Foreign Exchange contracts.  If later an actual account is opened (e.g. current account or savings account) it will not be necessary to input this information again since the Customer base number is an integral part of the Customer Account record and T24 always refers to the Customer base record for all basic information.</p><p /><p>                                                  Most Applications refer to the Customer base record during processing, therefore it must be opened before any Customer activity can be recorded in T24 Customer records for banks, correspondent banks, Agents, etc. should ideally be opened at installation of the System even if these banks are not 'real' Customers of your institution.  The existence of these Customer records will minimise the input of data in Transaction Processing Applications like Money Market, Foreign Exchange, Funds Transfer, etc. where details of banks are always necessary to indicate the settlement details of the transaction.</p><p /><p>                                                  Details in the Customer base record are descriptive and not financial, i.e. Customer's Mnemonic, Short Name, Address, Nationality, Relationships, etc. are recorded rather than details of balances which are available in separate records, e.g. Customer Accounts.</p><p /><p>                                                  The following is a selection of the information that can be loaded on a Customer record:</p><p /><p>                                                  - Customer classifications, for example, by Industry and Sector code, to   enable reports to be extracted based on this information.</p><p /><p>                                                  - Customer relationships, for example Parent, Subsidiary, Head Office,   Husband, Father etc, which enables customers to be grouped, for   additional reporting and analysis purposes, by whatever criteria the   user requires.  Up to 999 relationships can be defined for each   Customer.</p><p /><p>                                                  The System will then automatically update an internal file   (RELATION.CUSTOMER) which can be displayed on line and allows the user   to see in a simple enquiry facility, the various relations which have   been defined between different customer records.</p><p /><p>                                                  - The main Account Officer of a Customer, which will be used as a default   on all Customer transactions unless it is overridden at transaction   level.  Up to 999 Other replacement Account Officers can be assigned to   each customer where necessary.</p><p /><p>                                                  - The Liability identification of a Customer which will allow various   Customer records to be grouped under the same liability number for   credit risk purpose.  This liability number will then be used as the key   to access the Limit file.</p><p /><p>                                                  - The Global identification of a Customer which will allow to uniquely   identify multinational Customers across all branches of a bank on a   worldwide basis.</p><p /><p>                                                  - A Review frequency which allows the user to specify for any Customer a   frequency indicating when any type of review should take place.  The   System will then automatically update an internal file   (CUSTOMER.FREQUENCY) which can be displayed on line and will provide the   User with the complete list of Customers due for review or for whom some   action has to be taken.</p></ovdesc>
