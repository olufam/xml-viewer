<overview>
<ovdesc>
<p>The purpose of this table is to indicate the public holidays for each Country, or Region within a Country, for the calendar years over which the bank's current business is spread. </p><p>The User must indicate, for each Country or Region, the public holidays and which day(s) of the week make up the weekend.  The non-working weekend days are then generated automatically for the year and for this reason they do not have to be specified individually as public holidays. </p><p>Each T24 Application will refer to this table during input validation to verify that any dates entered by the User are working days or to force an override to accept non-working days.  It is also used to determine the delivery date, by taking non-working days into consideration. </p><p>The REGION and COUNTRY tables must be set up before this table can be created. </p></ovdesc>
