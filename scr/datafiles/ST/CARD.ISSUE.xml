<overview>
<ovdesc>
<p>CARD.ISSUE is one of the two central applications of the cheque and card control system.</p><p>The issue of cards to an account is controlled by the entry of records on this table. Entry to this table is similar to entering a transaction within other T24 modules. The most significant information entered on a CARD.ISSUE record is contained in the record ID. This defines the card type being issued and the card number involved.</p><p>Contained in each record is the account number to which the card is being issued, the date of issue, any charges incurred at issue time and expiry date of the card.</p><p>A charge entry may be raised for the issue depending on the charging structure defined for the card type on the CARD.CHARGE table. The system checks against account conditions and limits and will require overrides when appropriate. Only accounts with a category defined as allowed in the CARD.TYPE table may be entered for the card type being processed.</p></ovdesc>
