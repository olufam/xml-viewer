<p>The Company file contains details of the Company's name, the Mnemonic (by which all the files maintain at this company's level are prefixed), the file classification details, the applications to be run and Company level defaults and parameters.</p><p>    The Reverse (R) function is not allowed for a company record. The input, copy, delete, authorise, see and print functions are all available.</p><p>    This application is invoked from one of two sources:</p><p>    (a) Automatically from within the installation process for the loading     of a new processing company record.</p><p>    (b) On-line to enable amendment or enquiry and the loading of a new     Consolidation Company record.</p><p>    The procedures for setting up a new processing company are explained in the Installation guide.</p><p>    For reporting purposes a Consolidation Company may be required.  A Consolidation Company could be used to cover something like a Continent/ Region, that is a non-existing Company.</p><p>    Once a Company record has been loaded it is possible On-line to amend certain fields and also to view each field, whether input, internal or externally maintained, together with the associated field level help-text.</p><p>    There are 3 types of non consolidation company record, all of which can produce a full set of financail reports.</p><p>    The Master company is the very first company installed on the system (usually BNK).</p><p>    A Lead company is a company that owns its own financial files, (the Master company is a Lead Company). A lead company is the equivalent of a company in a multi company set up.</p><p>    A Branch company is linked to a Lead company  and uses the same data files as its Lead company with the exception of financial reporting files.</p><p>    The type of company is determined when the company is created via the COMPANY.CREATE application.</p><p>    Files containing financial records are kept separate for each Company, but can be combined, for reporting purposes.</p><p>    The non-financial data files can be shared with other companies or can be separate depending upon the details loaded for the Company.</p><p>    The standard name of this file is COMPANY.</p></ovdesc>
