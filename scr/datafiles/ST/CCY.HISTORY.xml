            <p>CCY.HISTORY is a new 'L'ive type file containing the effective dates of currency rate changes for any currency for any year.  The file also holds the currency file current number at the effective date. </p>
            <p>To achieve the implementation of this file at existing sites the BLD.CURRENCY.HIS routine is used to build complete records in the CURRENCY$HIS file, and the BLD.CCY.HISTORY routine is used to build CCY.HISTORY records from the CURRENCY$HIS file. </p>
            <p>The CCY.HISTORY file is maintained by the EOD.CCY.HISTORY routine in CCY.CYCLE.DATA at end of day.  Complete CURRENCY file recors will be maintained by the AUTH.RECORD.WRITE routine. </p>
            <p>In addition there is a GET.CCY.HISTORY routine that will obtain the required currency record from a date and currency code. </p>
