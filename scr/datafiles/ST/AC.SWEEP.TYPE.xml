<ovdesc>
<p>This record is used to define user sweep types based on one of the standard types. Each one can be slightly modified therby allowing many variations on the sweeps.</p><p>The transaction codes, return sweep options as well as user defined routines can be defined here.</p></ovdesc>

<field>RTN.WITH.SW.AMT</field>
<desc><p>If set to YES then the system expects the local routine to have 4 parameters in the following order:</p><p>1. Balance of TO account</p><p>2. Balance of FROM account</p><p>3. Sweep amount calculated by system</p><p>4. Cash pool link record.</p><p>Except parameter 3, all the other parameters are input parameters and are not supposed to be modified by the local routine. Sweep amount is an input/output parameter and the modified value from the local routine will be used by the system as the final sweep amount.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>Must be either YES or blank</p><p /></desc>

<field>RESTRICT.SWEEP</field>
<desc><p>Identifies whether a Sweep process  (defined in AC.ACCOUNT.LINK application) with this Sweep type (Field: SWEEP.TYPE),  should be stopped,  when  a  POSTING.RESTRICT is specified  in  CUSTOMER or ACCOUNT record or  a Block is specified   in SAM record or  the field DEBIT.RESTRICT  is set to YES in ACCT.GROUP.CONDITION record  related to the  accounts  involved in the sweep.</p><p>The SWEEP will  be processed   inspite of  the above referred restrictions , if this field is set to NO or NULL.  However, in that case, the relative STMT.ENTRY records  will contain  all the overrides generated  during the sweep process.</p><p>When the field is set to to YES,  the sweep  process would be stopped depending  on the following conditions:</p><p>1.  When  a POSTING.RESTRICT whose  RESTRICTION.TYPE is ALL or DEBIT is attached to the  CUSTOMER whose ACCOUNT is to be debited or to the debit ACCOUNT itself in a Sweep process,  then it  would be stopped.</p><p>2.  When  a POSTING.RESTRICT whose  RESTRICTION.TYPE is ALL or CREDIT is attached to the CUSTOMER whose ACCOUNT is to be credited or to the credit  ACCOUNT itself in a sweep process, then it  would be stopped.</p><p>3.  When a  ACCOUNT (whether debited or credited) in a Sweep process is attached to a SEC.ACC.MASTER record which is blocked (Field BLOCKING.DATE is set to a value), then the Sweep would be stopped from the date specified as BLOCKING.DATE.</p><p>4.  If  the field DEBIT.RESTRICT is set to YES in the ACCT.GROUP.CONDITION record  of an   Account which is to be debited in a sweep process, then it would be stopped.</p><p>Whenever a sweep process is stopped due to any of the above referred conditions, the details would be written to the file AC.ACCOUNT.LINK.ERROR at Batch processing.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>YES, NO or NULL.</p><p>Default is NULL</p><p>Optional Input</p><p>Field is NOINPUT when RS product is not installed</p></desc>

<field>USE.LIMITS</field>
<desc><p>This field behaves in different ways for Account Sweeping (AC.ACCOUNT.LINK) and Cash Pool (AC.CASH.POOL) processing.</p><p>The setting of this field will effect the Account Sweep and Cash Pooling.</p><p>Account Sweeps will process any transfers based on the balance on the Account, if this field is set to YES then any overdraft Limit will be included and the amount to be transferred may therefore be larger. Setting this field to No will disregard any Limit.</p><p>Cash Pooling by it's very nature can be transferring amounts across many accounts at various levels. It would be inappropriate to restrict a transfer due to an unauthorised overdraft when it may be offset by a later credit within the pool. Setting this field gives the option to allow all transfers within the pool or restricting them in accordance with standard account level checking.</p><p>For cash pooling the field is to allow overdraft irrespective of the limit.</p><p>Yes - Overdraft will be allowed upto the sanctioned limit amount.(If no limit is attached then sweeping will be done for account balance only)</p><p>No - Overdraft is allowed irrespective of the Limit (whether it exist or not)</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>The following values are permitted: YES, NO</p></desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>PRIORITISE.OD</field>
<desc><p>If the PRIORITISE.OD field is set to No then the funds are all swept into the first from account. If PRIORITISE.OD is set to yes then it sweeps the funds into  any from accounts that are currently over drawn and takes them to zero, any remaining funds are placed in the first from account.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>A maximum of 3 characters may be entered.</p><p>The following values are permitted: YES, NO</p><p>Field is NOINPUT when RS product is not installed</p></desc>

<t>
<field>SWEEP.TYPE</field>
<desc><p>Sweep types can be defined with different transaction codes for the Maintenance, Surplus, Two-way or CASHFLOW Sweep.</p><p>SWEEP.TYPE is assigned for linked accounts, linked through the AC.ACCOUNT.LINK table.</p><p>It must be the key to a record on the SWEEP.TYPE file</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>Up to 35 type A (alphanumeric) characters.</p></desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>SWEEP.STYLE</field>
<desc><p>Identifies the style of the Sweep.</p><p>The following sweep styles will be accepted:</p><p>MAINTENANCE (Standard Sweep)</p><p>This sweep style involves sweeping funds from the from account to the to account when the to</p><p>Account falls below its minimum limit.</p><p>SURPLUS (Return Sweep)</p><p>This sweep style involves sweeping funds from the to account to the from account when the</p><p>balance in the to account goes above its maximum value.</p><p>TWO-WAY (Sweep and Return Sweep)</p><p>This sweep style is simply a Maintenance Sweep and a Return Sweep in one link. In this</p><p>Case, the Maintenance Sweep always goes first.</p><p>CASHFLOW (like Two-way)</p><p>Similar to the Two-way except that the total amounts that can be requested are subject to a user defined limit.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>It can only be MAINTENANCE, SURPLUS, TWO-WAY or CASHFLOW.</p></desc>

<field>ACCT.MODE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the accounting mode to be used for executing sweeps.</p>
            <p>Acceptable values are:</p>
            <p>
                <p value="1">SAO – System accepts the overrides encountered while executing a sweep and processes the sweep. The successful sweeps are stored in AC.ACCOUNT.SWEEP.HIST.</p>
                <p value="2">SNP – System rejects the overrides encountered while executing a sweep and does not process the sweep. The rejected sweeps are stored in AC.ACCOUNT.SWEEP.ERROR.</p>
            </p>
            <p>Default value is set to ‘SAO’.</p>

<t>
<field>AMT.SWEEP.ROUTINE</field>
<desc><p>This holds an optional routine for calculating the sweep amount. For sweep type used in AC.CASH.POOL, this AMT.SWEEP.ROUTINE should have 2 arguments.</p><p>First argument is the Cash Pool Link Id passed to the routine and the second argument to be returned by the routine should be the amount to be swept. However the amount to be swept is subject to the Upto amount if specified.</p><p /><p>Example:</p><p>Assume Cash pool set up has 'SURPLUS' sweep type with max amt USD 1000.00.</p><p>As the acct balance is greater than USD 1000.00 (satisfying the rule), the routine will be called.</p><p>The routine returns sweep amount as USD 4000.00 (in the second argument) and sweep takes place for USD4000.</p><p>In case upto amount is specified as USD500, then Sweeping will be done for USD 500.00</p><p>Note:</p><p>In case account balance is less than 1000.00, then the routine will not be called and sweep amt will be 0 as the minimum condition for sweeping has failed.</p></desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>BALANCE.TO.USE</field>
<desc><p>Specify the balance to be used to arrive the available balance for AC.CASH.POOL, when it is setup with this Sweep.Type.</p><p>Balance.to.use can be ONLINE.ACTUAL, ONLINE.CLEARED or WORKING balance or AC.BALANCE.TYPE.</p><p>Balance.to.use specified here alone will be used for arriving the available balance provided the Back value adjustment flag in AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM is not equal to YES. If it is YES then Balance.to.use given in AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM will be used.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p>Optional Field</p><p> Optional Field Valid values ONLINE ACTUAL or ONLINE CLEARED or WORKING or WORKING LESS LOCKED AMOUNT or AC.BALANCE.TYPE</p></desc>
