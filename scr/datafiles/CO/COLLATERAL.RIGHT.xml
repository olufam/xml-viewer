<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The collateral right file is used to record the status of a right of security and to indicate against which customer outstandings the right applies. </p>
            <p>The link between the collateral right and the collateral object itself is implicit in the item-id structure between the two files. </p>
            <p />
            <p>LIMIT REFERENCE </p>
            <p>The limit reference field on the collateral right record is used to identify which contract(s) the collateral is valid against. </p>
            <p>This link between the collateral and the outstanding debit balances belonging to the customer may be made at one of three levels as follows: </p>
            <p>contract/account level: the collateral is valid only against a given contract or set of contracts. </p>
            <p>limit level: the collateral is valid against all contracts currently recorded under a particular limit reference and against any contracts which subsequently come under that limit. </p>
            <p>customer level: the collateral is valid against any debit balance which exists or arises on the customer's accounts or contracts with the bank. </p>
            <p>The latter case is implied by leaving the limit reference field blank on the collateral right record. Otherwise, the appropriate limits or contract references should be entered. </p>
            <p>It is important to note that, if collateral values are being used in a process of reallocating debit balances across general ledger (or central bank) reporting lines, the level at which this link is made affects the priority with which debit balances are considered for reallocation. If a mixture of these levels is in use, all contract/account level balances will be considered first by the system, followed by limit-level balances and finally, any remaining balances attributable at customer-level will be considered. </p>

<field>STATUS</field>
<desc>
            <p>The status of the collateral right. </p>
            <p>The status of the collateral right is indicated in this field as follows: </p>
            <p>FWD - forward status; validity date is forward; </p>
            <p>CUR - current status; expiry date is forward &amp; validity date is not; </p>
            <p>LIQ - liquidated status; expiry date is past; </p>
            <p>MAT - matured status; record occurs only on history file. </p>
            <p>The only status under which a collateral right is considered by the system's reallocation process is current. </p>
            <p>In most cases, the status indicated against the collateral right will also be indicated against any collateral objects belonging to the right. The sole exception is when a collateral object has an earlier expiry date than its corresponding right (in which case the object is considered expired whilst the right remains current). </p>
            <p>This field is automatically maintained by the system by an end-of-day process and is updated in accordance with any changes to the dates entered on-line. </p>

            <p>The item-id's of any limit records which are linked to the collateral right. </p>
            <p>This field, which is automatically maintained by the system, contains a list of item-id's to the limit file.  This list indicates records against which the value of the collateral may be allocated by the system. The list is derived from the content of LIMIT.REFERENCE. It contains only those limits which are marked as 'secured' and which belong to a limit line indicated by one or more of the foregoing references. </p>

            <p>Although this is mainly for reporting and management purposes, the presence of a date in this field also blocks the reallocation process for the collateral values (after such date has passed). </p>
            <p>A past date in this field always indicates a status of 'liquidated', both on the collateral right itself and on any associated collateral objects. </p>

<field>PERCENTAGE.COVER</field>
<desc>
            <p>The percentage of cover which applies to the collateral. </p>
            <p>The percentage of cover belonging to a collateral right is calculated by the formula: </p>
            <p>             % of cover = 100 x debit balance / value </p>
            <p>where: </p>
            <p>debit balance = (sum of) debit balance(s) under the limit reference (or                 contract id) belonging to the collateral right. </p>
            <p>value = (sum of) net execution value(s) belonging to collateral objects         attached to the right, </p>
            <p>net execution value = execution value - third party value. </p>
            <p>Note that, for the purposes of this calculation, the system always assumes that the entire value of a given entity belongs exclusively to the right under which it occurs. </p>
            <p>The percentage of cover may initially be entered by the user and subsequently updated periodically by the system according to a frequency determined per collateral code. </p>
            <p>This field may take the value zero (=0%) or null (=unknown or not applicable) or greater than 100%. </p>
            <p>The system-calculated value is available as an on-line default (when attached collateral values have been authorized), but will not override any user-input. </p>
            <p>The value in this field is for information only, and has no subsequent impact on the system's reallocation process (ie. in determining whether a given level of excess value exists). </p>
            <p>Note : If the system's calculation of this value yields an invalid result,        the value 999 will be returned. </p>

<field>PERCENT.ALLOC</field>
<desc>
            <p>If a percentage value is entered then Collateral can be allocated to a limit at any level i.e. product, sub product or below sub product level.</p>
            <p>If no value is entered then collateral will be allocated at the top level of the limit structure for the limit defined in the associated LIMIT.REFERENCE field.</p>
            <p>If a percentage value is entered then that percentage of the execution value of the relevant collateral item will be allocated to the SECURED.AMT of the limit record defined in the associated LIMIT.REFERENCE field.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 1: - No percentage values entered</strong>
            </p>
            <p>Collateral execution value = 8m.</p>
            <p>Limit1 then limit2 are defined in the LIMIT.REFERENCE field.</p>
            <p>Limit 1 defined as MAXIMUM.SECURED of 8m on limit record.</p>
            <p>Limit 2 defined as MAXIMUM.SECURED of 8m on limit record.</p>
            <p>Limit 2 is utilised by a transaction of 5m, which results in a SECURED.AMT of 5m.</p>
            <p>Limit 1 is then utilised by a transaction of 5m, which results in a SECURED.AMT of 3m, the remainder of the collateral.</p>
            <p>Then the batch processing takes place.</p>
            <p>The limits will be modified so that limit 1 (the first limit defined on COLLATERAL.RIGHT) will have a SECURED.AMT of 5m while limit 2 now has a secured amount of 3m, (the remainder). </p>
            <p><strong>Example 2: - Percentage values entered</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The limit structure is as follows.</p>
            <p>Limit 100 is at product level.</p>
            <p>Limit 101 is at sub product level.</p>
            <p>Limit 102 is at sub product level</p>
            <p>Limit 103 is at sub product level</p>
            <p>Collateral with an execution value of 8m is assigned as follows via LIMIT.REFERENCE and PERCENT.ALLOC</p>
            <p>75% to limit 101.</p>
            <p>25% to limit 102.</p>
            <p>In this case all of the collateral is assigned to the limit structure 100.</p>
            <p>The secured amount, which will be allocated to limit 101, is 6m (75% of the execution value of 8m) and 2m for limit 102 (25% of the collateral execution value).</p>
            <p>If limit 101 is utilised for more than 6m and limit 102 is not used then the secured amount for 101 will still be 6m.</p>
            <p>If a transaction takes place which impacts limit 103 then the secured amount will be zero, as the limit has not been defined on COLLATERAL.RIGHT.</p>
