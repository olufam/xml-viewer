            <p>Activity Name:</p>
            <p />is a valid PW.ACTIVITY key that exists on the PW.PROCESS.DEFINITION record. The activity must have run before the activity that the data is being mapped to and to which the PW.MAPPING key is being attached.   <p>Field Name: is the field name (not number) off the transaction record that is related to the PW.ACTIVITY record. This is the field where the data will come from or will be used as a key to the linked Application.Name. The linking/syntax can stop here if the data from this field is the data that will be mapped.</p><p>Application Name: A valid T24 Application name. This application will be read using the data from the previous linked &amp;#8216;Field&amp;#8217; as the key to the file.</p><p>OPEN.ACCOUNT&gt;ACCOUNT.OFFICER&gt;DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER&gt;DEPT.PARENT&gt;DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER&gt;DELIVERY.POINT</p><p>OPEN.ACCOUNT = A valid PW.ACTIVITY where the Target field is set to &amp;#8216;ACCOUNT&amp;#8217;</p><p>ACCOUNT.OFFICER = Field off the ACCOUNT Application. The data from this field is used to read the DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER Application.</p><p>DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER = The next application to be read using the data from the previous field, ACCOUNT.OFFICER.</p><p>DEPT.PARENT = Field on the DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER record to retrieve data from to use as key to next Application.</p><p>DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER = The next application (coincidently) read using data from the previous DEPT.PARENT field as the key.</p><p>DELIVERY.POINT = Finally the data from this field off the DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER record is mapped into the correlating TARGET.FIELD</p><p>EG.2</p><p /><p /><p />&amp;#8216;CUSTOMER&amp;#8217;&gt;Field Name   <p>As long as the CUSTOMER id is inputted manually into the PW.PROCESS record, this will return the data from the field defined in Field Name off the CUSTOMER record.</p><p /><p /><p>EG.3</p><p /><p>Unique.Name &gt;Field name</p><p>Unique name is the unique name give to an activity on the PW.PROCESS.DEFINITION record. This name can be used where 2 identical PW.ACTIVITYs are defined on one PW.PROCESS.DEFINITION record, to differentiate between the two.</p><p>The rest of the syntax is the same as in EG.1</p><p>EG.4</p><p /><p>&amp;#8216;!TODAY&amp;#8217; &amp;#8211; Defaults the date of the day into the corresponding TARGET.FIELD</p><p>EG.5</p><p /><p>@Routine name.</p><p>Allows a valid routine name ( the routine name must exist in the EB.API application). The routine must return 1 argument containing the data to be mapped into the correlating TARGET.FIELD</p><p>EG.6</p><p /><p>Acitivity Name&gt;@ID; Defaults the ID of the related Activity into the corresponding TARGET.FIELD. The related Activity must be a previously run activity within the process which contains a PW.ACTIVITY.TXN record and a populated Transaction.Ref field. </p><p /><p /><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p /><p /><p />Up to 35 alphanumeric characters.  <p /><p /><p />Multi-value field.  <p /><p /><p />See individual examples above.    </desc>
