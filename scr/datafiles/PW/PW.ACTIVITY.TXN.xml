            <p>   PW.ACTIVITY.TXN</p>
            <p />
            <p>   The records in this table are created automatically by the system. The records are created either at the time of authorization of the PW.PROCESS record or upon the completion of an activity. Upon completion of an activity, the system scans through the PROCESS.DEFINTION record and creates PW.ACTIVITY.TXN records for all activities that could be started now.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   PW.ACTIVITY.TXN records also contain the start date /end date of the particular activity. Also the T24 transaction reference is stored. A concat file PW.TXN.REF is also updated with the transaction reference for later reference and easy retrieval.</p>

            <p>           When the corresponding transaction has been run and it meets the STATUS.RULES set in the PW.ACTIVITY record which in turn changes the STATUS.CODES. When this STATUS.CODE matches what is defined in the PW.PROCESS.DEFINITION as COMPLETE.STAT and the PW.ACTIVITY COMPLETE flag for this STATUS.RULES is set to Yes, then this transaction will be seen as complete.</p>
