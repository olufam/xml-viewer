            <p />
            <p> The user may define the set of rules governing the specific product category of the LD. Within a category, rules may be defined for each currency. These rules are validated at the time of initial input of the deal only. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> This table could be used to default the interest rate (or key plus spread) charges and commissions, etc., on to the LD deal. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> The table can also be used to control the term and drawdown amount to pre-defined ranges for a specific product category and currency. Should the user input a LD for a term or drawdown amount exceeding the tolerance specified in this table, appropriate overrides are generated at the deal. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> If the default values for the respective category are modified at the deal, appropriate overrides are generated. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> For Certificate of Deposit (CD) type of products, tolerances for the user-input value either in absolute amount or in percentage formats may also be defined in this table.</p>

            <p>  D/DAILY: to specify daily schedules. In the LD contract this would be defaulted to show a daily frequency starting from the day after the value date of the contract.</p>
            <p>  Wn / WEEKn : to specify weekly schedules starting n weeks from the value date of the contract. For example if the input is W1, for a contract dated February 14, 2002, the interest frequency would be on a weekly basis beginning February 21, 2002.</p>
            <p>  Mxxnn: to specify monthly schedules every xx months on nn date of the month. For example if the input is M0315, for a contract value dated February 14, 2002, the first schedule generated would be on February 15,2002, the next schedule on May 15, 2002 and so on. It is also possible to simply specify the no. of months in the frequency without specifying the date component. In the above example, if the input was M03, the first interest schedule will start 3 months from the value date of the contract on the anniversary of the value date of the contract. For example, for a contract input on February 14, 2002, the next interest due date will be on May 14, 2002.</p>

            <p> While settling the dues in a LD where liquidation is made in a currency other then the deal currency, the user may input the exchange rate for each scheduled day for each currency (in which dues are repaid) in SETTLEMENT.RATES table. If the bank desires to use a single rate for all liquidations in a specific currency(s), a new currency market may be created in order to define the liquidation rate for each currency. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> First a new market has to be created in CURRENCY.MARKET. The default exchange rate that is to be used for settlement is input in the respective currency tables under the specific market chosen. User may input the BUY &amp; SELL rates for all currencies in which settlement may take place on that day. Based on the value in SETTLEMENT.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE (which may be BUY/SELL/MID) in the deal, the appropriate rate is used for conversion purposes during EOD.</p>

            <p />
            <p> If the user has input a rate in EV.APPL.RATE in SETTLEMENT.RATES table for a particular deal, then this rate is considered for conversion. Should there be no input in EV.APPL.RATE for the deal for the scheduled date, the rate in the CURRENCY table for the CURRENCY.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE defined in the deal is used for conversion. Eg. The bank desires to have a single conversion rate for all GBP loan dues that are settled in USD. In this case single input of exchange rate in the currency table for the relevant market and conversion type would suffice. If the rate that is to be applied to a particular deal is different, respective rate may be defined in EV.APPL.RATE.</p>
            <p> The value input here would be defaulted at the deal level for the relevant category.</p>

For example if the input is W1, for a contract dated February 14, 2002, the interest frequency would be on a weekly basis beginning February 21, 2002. Mxxnn: to specify monthly schedules every xx months on nn date of the month. For example if the input is M0315, for a contract value dated February 14, 2002, the first schedule generated would be on February 15,2002, the next schedule on May 15, 2002 and so on. It is also possible to simply specify the no. of months in the frequency without specifying the date component. In the above example, if the input was M03, the first interest schedule will start 3 months from the value date of the contract on the anniversary of the value date of the contract. For example, for a contract input on February 14, 2002, the next interest due date will be on May 14, 2002. BSNSS : this will generate interest schedules on every business day. Apart from the above, the records specified in EB.FREQUENCY application can also be input in this field.</p>
        <p>INTEREST.KEY</p>
        <p>Reference number of the appropriate key that will be used for interest computation. The key should be present in the BASIC.RATE.TEXT table and value should be present for the respective currency in the BASIC.INTEREST table. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1-4 numeric characters Must be present in BASIC.RATE.TEXT table Optional Input. Either Interest rate or Interest Key plus spread can be inpu.</p>
        <p>INTEREST.RATE</p>
        <p>Default interest rate for the LD category The rate to be defaulted to the INTEREST.RATE field in LD for interest computation of loans and deposits contracts and commitment fee calculation for commitment contracts. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1-10 numeric characters plus a decimal point. Input must be positive value. Value cannot exceed 100. Optional Input. Either Interest rate or Interest Key plus spread can be inpu.</p>
        <p>INTEREST.SPREAD</p>
        <p>Default interest spread (margin) to be added/subtracted from the rate defined in the associated interest key. For contracts with the category code of this LD.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION this spread will be used to default the end user rate. For loan type contracts this would normally be a spread added to the floating rate; for deposits it would normally be a deduction. Note the end user spread can also be affected by values in the LD.GROUP.CONDITION where a further override/default of the spread can be defined by group. Example Base Rate 10% In record 21050 INTEREST.SPREAD = 1.00 therefore defaulted spread would be 11% (10% + 1%) In record 21030 INTEREST.SPREAD = -0.5 therefore defaulted spread would be 9.5% (10% - 0.5%) See LD.GROUP.CONDITION for additional examples </p>

Include both first (only value date) and last day of accrual period. Adjust the principal increase and decrease effective dates for interest calculation and accrual calculation purposes.</p>
        <p>MATURE.AT.SOD</p>
        <p>Flag for maturing a LD contract during Start of Day . If set to YES, maturity entries would be raised during Start of Day process. This rule is applicable for all types of contracts with or without schedules. All scheduled events like principal, interest, commission etc., would be processed during start of day. Required STMT.ENTRY(s) and CATEG.ENTRY(s) would be generated during start of day. CONSOL.ENT.TODAY records would be raised during SOD for all deal level updations like repayment of principal, capitalisation of interest or liquidation of contract. If not set to YES, maturity entries would be generated during End of Day process.

If the bank desires to use a single rate for all liquidations in a specific currency(s), a new currency market may be created in order to define the liquidation rate for each currency. First a new market has to be created in CURRENCY.MARKET. The default exchange rate that is to be used for settlement is input in the respective currency tables under the specific market chosen. User may input the BUY &amp; SELL rates for all currencies in which settlement may take place on that day. Based on the value in SETTLEMENT.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE (which may be BUY/SELL/MID) in the deal, the appropriate rate is used for conversion purposes during EOD. If the user has input a rate in EV.APPL.RATE in SETTLEMENT.RATES table for a particular deal, then this rate is considered for conversion. Should there be no input in EV.APPL.RATE for the deal for the scheduled date, the rate in the CURRENCY table for the CURRENCY.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE defined in the deal is used for conversion. Eg. The bank desires to have a single conversion rate for all GBP loan dues that are settled in USD. In this case single input of exchange rate in the currency table for the relevant market and conversion type would suffice. If the rate that is to be applied to a particular deal is different, respective rate may be defined in EV.APPL.RATE. The value input here would be defaulted at the deal level for the relevant category. </p>
