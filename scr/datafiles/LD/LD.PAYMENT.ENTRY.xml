            <p>PAYMENT ENTRY RULES </p>
            <p>Input of manual payments via LD PAYMENT ENTRY is prohibited. </p>
            <p>The update functions (e.g. INPUT) are not permitted for automatic payments. </p>
            <p>One automatic payment entry may result in one, two or no physical payment messages. </p>
            <p>        1 physical payment message is produced if all payment instructions           of all components are the same. </p>
            <p>        2 physical payment messages are produced if the principal payment           instructions differ from the interest payment instruction. </p>
            <p>No physical payment messages are produced if the customer of the Nostro account being credited is the same as the beneficiary customer.  In this case the confirmation suffices. </p>
