            <p>The Commercial Loans and Deposits Module automates the control,</p>
            <p>administration, accounting and management information requirements</p>
            <p>of both pre and post maturity processing on a Bank's Portfolio.</p>
            <p>A wide range of products are catered for and these may be classified</p>
            <p>into five generic groups:-</p>
            <p>A Commercial Loan   An asset product which provides an</p>
            <p>extensive range of processing in relation                     to the</p>
            <p>physical extension of credit to a                     borrower.</p>
            <p>A Commercial DepositA liability product which provides an</p>
            <p>extensive range of processing facilities.</p>
            <p>A Commitment        A product type which controls those</p>
            <p>instances where a contractual obligation                     to lend</p>
            <p>exists and/or the bank wishes to                     levy commitment</p>
            <p>fees based on usage etc.</p>
            <p>A Sundry Deposit    A miscellaneous item due to a customer.</p>
            <p>A Sundry Loan       A miscellaneous item due from a                     customer.</p>
            <p>The module has been designed to be as flexible as possible in</p>
            <p>managing the various products it covers, and automating as many</p>
            <p>functions as one would encounter in the typical Commercial Loans and</p>
            <p>Deposits Department of a Bank.</p>
            <p>It provides a comprehensive set of on-line enquiry facilities,</p>
            <p>operational, marketing and management reports which obviate the need</p>
            <p>for loan ledger cards and other types of documentation traditionally</p>
            <p>maintained manually.</p>
            <p>The system can if required process a transaction through its life</p>
            <p>cycle without any intervention from the user, alternatively, the</p>
            <p>user can opt for full manual control.</p>
            <p>All processing results in the automatic generation of payments,</p>
            <p>billings, chasers, contract/rate amendment documentation etc.</p>
            <p>The Bank has full control over the parameters associated with the</p>
            <p>life cycle of a transaction  eg indicating the number of days after</p>
            <p>an event when the transaction is considered to be a past due</p>
            <p>obligation.  Such parameters are specified in tables which can be</p>
            <p>amended at any time.</p>
            <p>The main features of the module can be described as follows:-</p>
            <p>Multi-Currency drawdown or liquidation.</p>
            <p>Contracts can be denominated in a currency different from that of the</p>
            <p>drawdown or liquidation accounts. Full control is always maintained</p>
            <p>in terms of Negotiable, User input or Default Exchange rates</p>
            <p>applicable to the transaction.</p>
            <p>Fixed Maturity and Call/Notice.</p>
            <p>The system processes both Fixed date and Call/Notice type transactions.</p>
            <p>Interest bearing and discounted loans and deposits.</p>
            <p>Both interest bearing and discounted contracts can be processed.</p>
            <p>These can be either single or multiple period transactions.</p>
            <p>Five days basis upon which interest/commission will be calculated.</p>
            <p>Five days basis currently exist within the system, these are as follows:-</p>
            <p>360/360           366/360           360/365           366/365</p>
            <p>Special basis.</p>
            <p>Five different interest types.</p>
            <p>The following interest types are employed offering a wide range of</p>
            <p>options for the way in which a bank will structure the interest</p>
            <p>component on a transaction:-</p>
            <p>Fixed</p>
            <p>Floating                      Base rate linked</p>
            <p>Periodic Automatic type       Automatic Libor linked</p>
            <p>Periodic Manual type          manual Libor linked</p>
            <p>Periodic Straight type        manual libor linked</p>
            <p>Automatic or fully manual scheduling facilities for all the financial</p>
            <p>components. The scheduling facilities of the system accomodate</p>
            <p>either automatic or manual processing for single or multiple period</p>
            <p>transactions. Schedules can be defined for each of the following components:-</p>
            <p>Principal repayments Interest payments Commission</p>
            <p>payments Fee collections Revision rates</p>
            <p>Margin rates Diary events. Schedules are defined, on the</p>
            <p>input date for the appropriate events occuring during a contracts</p>
            <p>life. They may be changed individually, or collectively redefined at</p>
            <p>any point should the need arise.</p>
            <p>The schedule dates can be generated automatically by the system where</p>
            <p>they form part of a regular plan or can be input individually by the</p>
            <p>user when they result in irregular periods. Any combination of</p>
            <p>system generated and user input schedules is allowed.</p>
            <p>Automatic or manual liquidation facilities.</p>
            <p>The user can specify whether the system should automatically</p>
            <p>liquidate amounts due on each due date or await user intervention to</p>
            <p>manually effect the process.</p>
            <p>A further option exists which allows the liquidation of principal to</p>
            <p>be manual while all other components such as interest, commission,</p>
            <p>fees etc are automatically processed by the system.</p>
            <p>Local and Withholding Taxation.</p>
            <p>The module caters for the processing of local or withholding tax.</p>
            <p>Local tax is computed on any or all of the following components:-</p>
            <p>Principal Interest Commission</p>
            <p>Withholding tax on the other hand is computed solely on the interest</p>
            <p>component. The undermentioned four methods are employed and the</p>
            <p>system provides comprehensive facilities to track the Banks</p>
            <p>liability, the status in relation to outstanding receipts etc.</p>
            <p>"CN"  Customer Net "CG"  Customer Gross</p>
            <p>"BN"  Bank Net "BG"  Bank Gross</p>
            <p>Full post event and post maturity processing.</p>
            <p>Once an event has fallen due the user has the option of manually</p>
            <p>controlling the status, or allowing the system to control the status</p>
            <p>in accordance with parameters present on certain tables.</p>
            <p>Such parameters are specified by the Bank when implementating the</p>
            <p>system, they can however be changed at any time.</p>
            <p>The sequence of steps followed are as followed:-</p>
            <p>PAST DUE OBLIGATION "PDO" STATUS.</p>
            <p>Penalty accruals commence on either a financial or</p>
            <p>memorandum basis.</p>
            <p>NON ACCRUAL BASIS "NAB" STATUS.</p>
            <p>All financial accruals cease.   Memorandum accruals continue.</p>
            <p>Interest, commission, fees etc, are written off or</p>
            <p>capitalised dependending on the Banks implementation decisions.</p>
            <p>WRITE OFF "WOF" STATUS.</p>
            <p>The principal is written off and the contract is archived.</p>
            <p>Revolving and non revolving Commitments.</p>
            <p>The Commitment contract controls contractually committed lines and</p>
            <p>facilitates the accrual of commitment fees based on the original or</p>
            <p>unused amount of the contract.</p>
            <p>A Commitment can be either revolving or non revolving in nature. A</p>
            <p>revolving commitment results in the reinstating of the drawdown</p>
            <p>amount once it has been successfully liquidated. A non revolving</p>
            <p>Commitment is a reducing entity only.</p>
            <p>Automatic production of payment instructions plus all documentation.</p>
            <p>Documentation is produced automatically for each and every event</p>
            <p>indicated by the user at implementation time; likewise payment</p>
            <p>instructions are generated when appropriate.</p>
            <p>Once generated by the Loans And Deposits Module the records are</p>
            <p>handed off to the T24 Delivery System for subsequent processing.</p>
            <p>Comprehensive enquiry and reporting facilities.</p>
            <p>A full range of on-line enquiries and regular reports is provided.</p>
            <p>These have been designed to obviate traditional manual recording</p>
            <p>systems. These facilities will prove complimentary to back-office</p>
            <p>department, account officer, treasurer and the management of the bank.</p>

            <p>in order to define the liquidation rate for each currency.</p>
            <p />
            <p>First a new market has to be created in CURRENCY.MARKET. The</p>

            <p>(See Figure 3 below)</p>
            <p />
            <p>Be careful with IRR rates since, for example, a 10 year loan</p>
            <p>at 7% compounded Annually would need an IRR of over 9.9%</p>

            <p>Indicates whether automatic capitalisation of accrued</p>
            <p>interest will occur.</p>
            <p>This field has been defined to permit the automatic</p>
            <p>capitalisation of   interest at each interest due date on</p>
            <p>all transaction types.</p>
            <p>It is possible to modify this field throughout the life of a</p>
            <p>contract i.e.   even after the contract has been authorised.</p>
            <p>The system will combine the principal amount with the full</p>
            <p>amount of   interest accrued and will continue until the</p>
            <p>final maturity date is reached.</p>
            <p>However, if the interest on a deposit transaction is subject</p>
            <p>to local   taxes, only the net amount of the interest will</p>
            <p>be capitalised and the amount   of taxes will be credited to</p>
            <p>the corresponding tax sundry account.</p>

            <p>(A) Setting of</p>

            <p>(i) If in the discount transaction, straight discount method</p>
            <p>has been used (ie)YIELD.METHOD = NO , then the following</p>

            <p>time of rediscounting.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Profit from re-discounting = Bill Amount (Face Value) *</p>
            <p>(Discount Rate  Re-discount Rate) * No. Days left to</p>
            <p>maturity from rediscounting date</p>

            <p>Note: If the YIELD.METHOD is set to YES in the rediscount</p>
            <p>transaction, (ie) a discount to yield rate has been used,</p>
            <p>the effective straight rediscount rate would be derived and</p>
            <p>used in the above formula. The straight rediscount rate is</p>
            <p>to be arrived at as follows:</p>
            <p />
            <p>Straight re-discount rate</p>
            <p>=</p>

            <p>(ii) If in the discount transaction, a discount to yield rate</p>
            <p>has been used, (ie)</p>
            <p />
            <p>Profit from re-discounting = (Original Bill Transaction</p>

            <p>transaction, (ie) a straight discount rate has been used,</p>
            <p>the corresponding discount to yield rate would be derived</p>
            <p>and used in the above formula. This rate is to be arrived at</p>
            <p>as follows:</p>
            <p />
            <p>Discount to yield rate =</p>
            <p />
            <p>Where d: number of days according to the base in the</p>

            <p>rediscount transaction is to be adjusted for the base in the</p>

<field>BILL.NUMBER</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the number of a Trade Bill to be discounted or re-discounted.</p>
            <p>Details of individual trade bills are held in the application BILL.REGISTER.</p>
            <p>In order to discount or rediscount a bill or bundle of bills</p>
            <p>the key should be entered in this field. This will default</p>
            <p>the following information:</p>
            <p>AMOUNT The value of the Bill from BILL REGISTER CUSTOMER The</p>
            <p>DRAWEE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER CURRENCY The CURRENCY</p>
            <p>of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER MATURITY.DATE The</p>
            <p>MATURITY.DATE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER</p>
            <p>consequently operations on bundles of bills can only be</p>
            <p>applied where the customer, currency and maturity date are</p>
            <p>the same.</p>
            <p>DISCOUNT of Bills</p>
            <p>Bills can only be discounted when they have first been</p>
            <p>ACCEPTED. A Bill is accepted using the MD.DEAL module, once</p>
            <p>accepted the status in the BILL.REGISTER is set to ACCEPTED.</p>
            <p>When a bill is discounted the bank takes ownership of the</p>
            <p>Bill in return for payment of an amount which will be</p>
            <p>greater the closer to the maturity of the Bill. A discount</p>
            <p>rate is quoted which is used to calculate the amount to be</p>
            <p>paid. The amount to be paid is:</p>
            <p>Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Discount Rate * No Days)</p>
            <p>where: Bill Amount is held in BILL.REGISTER, No.Days is the</p>
            <p>number of days between value date and maturity date.</p>
            <p>A Bill Discount transaction should therefore entered in the</p>
            <p>Loans and Deposits application as a Discounted Loan using</p>
            <p>the following fields:</p>
            <p>INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = Discount Rate</p>
            <p>RE-DISCOUNT of Bills</p>
            <p>Bills can only be re-discounted when they have already been</p>
            <p>DISCOUNTED. A Bill is discounted as described above, ince</p>
            <p>discounted the status of the BILL.REGISTER record is set to DISCOUNTED.</p>
            <p>When a Bill is re-discounted the bank sells the Bill on in</p>
            <p>return for an amount which will be greater the closer to the</p>
            <p>maturity date of the Bill. A re-discount rate is quoted</p>
            <p>which is used to calculate the amount to receive. The amount</p>
            <p>to be received can be calculated as:</p>
            <p>Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Re-discount Rate * No Days)</p>
            <p>Once Bills are re-discounted they are no longer owned by the</p>
            <p>bank and should not appear in the books. The re-discount</p>
            <p>transaction is therefore entered as a deposit to offset the</p>
            <p>original discount. Since the discount and re-discount are</p>
            <p>unlikely to take place at the same rate, a profit or loss</p>
            <p>will be made on the rediscount transaction which should be</p>
            <p>realised immediately.</p>
            <p>In order to offset the discount transaction an amount is</p>
            <p>calculated based on the original discount rate for the</p>
            <p>remaining life of the Bill. This amount is held in the</p>
            <p>DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC field for all bills, the resulting</p>
            <p>ISSUE.PL.AMOUNT should be accrued over the remaining life of</p>
            <p>the contract to offset the discount accrual.</p>
            <p>The remaining profit or loss from the re-discount is stored</p>
            <p>in the CHRG.AMNT fields (see BILL.REDISC.RATE for details).</p>
            <p>The sum of the DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC and CHRG.AMNT fields is</p>
            <p>the total amount to be received.</p>
            <p>The following fields should be entered for a re-discount:</p>
            <p>INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = 0 BILL.REDISC.RATE =</p>

        <p>BILL.NUMBER</p>
        <p>Specifies the number of a Trade Bill to be discounted or re-discounted. Details of individual trade bills are held in the application BILL.REGISTER. In order to discount or rediscount a bill or bundle of bills the key should be entered in this field. This will default the following information: AMOUNT The value of the Bill from BILL REGISTER CUSTOMER The DRAWEE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER CURRENCY The CURRENCY of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER MATURITY.DATE The MATURITY.DATE of the Bill from BILL.REGISTER consequently operations on bundles of bills can only be applied where the customer, currency and maturity date are the same. DISCOUNT of Bills Bills can only be discounted when they have first been ACCEPTED. A Bill is accepted using the MD.DEAL module, once accepted the status in the BILL.REGISTER is set to ACCEPTED. When a bill is discounted the bank takes ownership of the Bill in return for payment of an amount which will be greater the closer to the maturity of the Bill. A discount rate is quoted which is used to calculate the amount to be paid. The amount to be paid is: Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Discount Rate * No Days) where: Bill Amount is held in BILL.REGISTER, No.Days is the number of days between value date and maturity date. A Bill Discount transaction should therefore entered in the Loans and Deposits application as a Discounted Loan using the following fields: INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = Discount Rate RE-DISCOUNT of Bills Bills can only be re-discounted when they have already been DISCOUNTED. A Bill is discounted as described above, ince discounted the status of the BILL.REGISTER record is set to DISCOUNTED. When a Bill is re-discounted the bank sells the Bill on in return for an amount which will be greater the closer to the maturity date of the Bill. A re-discount rate is quoted which is used to calculate the amount to receive. The amount to be received can be calculated as: Bill Amount - (Bill Amount * Re-discount Rate * No Days) Once Bills are re-discounted they are no longer owned by the bank and should not appear in the books. The re-discount transaction is therefore entered as a deposit to offset the original discount. Since the discount and re-discount are unlikely to take place at the same rate, a profit or loss will be made on the rediscount transaction which should be realised immediately. In order to offset the discount transaction an amount is calculated based on the original discount rate for the remaining life of the Bill. This amount is held in the DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC field for all bills, the resulting ISSUE.PL.AMOUNT should be accrued over the remaining life of the contract to offset the discount accrual. The remaining profit or loss from the re-discount is stored in the CHRG.AMNT fields (see BILL.REDISC.RATE for details). The sum of the DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC and CHRG.AMNT fields is the total amount to be received. The following fields should be entered for a re-discount: INT.PAYMT.METHOD = 2 INTEREST.RATE = 0 BILL.REDISC.RATE = Rediscount Rate </p>

        <p>While settling the dues in a LD where liquidation is made in a currency other then the deal currency, the user may input the exchange rate for each scheduled day for each currency (in which dues are repaid) in SETTLEMENT.RATES table. If the bank desires to use a single rate for all liquidations in a specific currency(s), a new currency market may be created in order to define the liquidation rate for each currency. First a new market has to be created in CURRENCY.MARKET. The default exchange rate that is to be used for settlement is input in the respective currency tables under the specific market chosen. User may input the BUY &amp; SELL rates for all currencies in which settlement may take place on that day. Based on the value in SETTLEMENT.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE (which may be BUY/SELL/MID) in the deal, the appropriate rate is used for conversion purposes during EOD. If the user has input a rate in EV.APPL.RATE in SETTLEMENT.RATES table for a particular deal, then this rate is considered for conversion. Should there be no input in EV.APPL.RATE for the deal for the scheduled date, the rate in the CURRENCY table for the CURRENCY.MARKET and CONVERSION.TYPE defined in the deal is used for conversion. Eg. The bank desires to have a single conversion rate for all GBP loan dues that are settled in USD. In this case single input of exchange rate in the currency table for the relevant market and conversion type would suffice.

        <p>This field can be used to manually control the status of the contract. Manual status control indicates that status changes are under the complete control of the user. Extreme caution should be exercised to ensure that the contract integrity is preserved. The system will not change the status according to the criteria indicated in either LMM INSTALLATION CONDITIONS or hard coded in a program; this is the total responsibility of the user. Automatic status control indicates that status changes are automatically actioned by the system according to the criteria indicated in either LMM INSTALL CONDITIONS or hard coded in a program. Interest basis (S)pecial transactions lose their special characteristics upon reaching the contract maturity date. The effect is as follows: A) Interest Basis "S" contracts will revert to the currency default days basis and use the contract rate for accrual purposes. It will not be possible to manually change the status of a contract while it is "CUR" without first setting it to manual. </p>

        <p>BILL.REDISC.RATE</p>
        <p>Specifies the rate to be used when Trade Bills are re-discounted. The bill or bills to be rediscounted are specfied in the BILL.NUMBER field, the details of each Bill are held in the BILL.REGISTER application. In order for a bill to be re-discounted it must first be discounted. When a bill is re-discounted a profit or loss will be made on the difference between the discount rate (held on Bill Register) and the Re-discount rate for the remaining period of the Bill. A profit is made is of the Discount rate is greater than the Re-discount rate. The profit and/or loss for all bills being re-discounted is recorded in the CHRG.AMNT fields together with a LMM.CHARGE.CONDITION code in the field CHRG.CODE. The codes defaulted are held in the field BILL.CHG.CODE in LMM.INSTALL.CONDS (value 1 is the profit code, value 2 is the loss code). The profit or loss for each bill is calculated as: Bill Amount * (Discount Rate - Re-discount Rate) * No.Days where Bill Amount and Discount Rate are held on BILL.REGISTER, and No.Days is the number of days between Value Date and ,Maturity Date according to the INTEREST.BASIS. The total amount to be recieved for the rediscount is the sum of the DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC and CHRG.AMNT fields. The DRAWDOWN.ISSUE.PRC is the sum of the value of the original discount for the remaining term for all bills being re-discounted. This is calculated for each bill as: Bill Amount * Discount Rate * No days where Bill Amount and Discount Rate are held on BILL.REGISTER, and No.Days is the number of days between Value Date and ,Maturity Date according to the INTEREST.BASIS. </p>

        <p>CAPITALISATION</p>
        <p>Indicates whether automatic capitalisation of accrued interest will occur. This field has been defined to permit the automatic capitalisation of interest at each interest due date on all transaction types. It is possible to modify this field throughout the life of a contract i.e. even after the contract has been authorised. The system will combine the principal amount with the full amount of interest accrued and will continue until the final maturity date is reached. However, if the interest on a deposit transaction is subject to local taxes, only the net amount of the interest will be capitalised and the amount of taxes will be credited to the corresponding tax sundry account. </p>

        <p>CHRG.AMOUNT</p>
        <p>Shows the flat amount of charges to be debited or credited to the Customer on the value date for a new contract, or on-line for an existing contract. The charges amounts will always be defined in contract currency. When a charge code defined in LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS contains a CHARGE.CODE linking it to FT.CHARGE.TYPE/FT.COMMISSION.TYPE, the charge amount will be defaulted when no input is made to this field. The charge amount will be based on the outstanding principal of the contract at input time, according to the rates defined in the FT charge tables. Charges may be be payable or receivable, as defined in LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS (field PAY.RECEIVE). Payable charges will be credited to the FEE.PAY.ACCOUNT, receivable charges will be debited from the CHRG.LIQ.ACCT. In the case of bill rediscounting transactions this field is system written by the amount of profit/loss on the transaction. The calculation of such profit/loss would depend on two factors: (A) Setting of (i) If in the discount transaction, straight discount method has been used (ie)YIELD.METHOD = NO , then the following formula would be used for arriving at the profit/loss at the time of rediscounting. Profit from re-discounting = Bill Amount (Face Value) * (Discount Rate Re-discount Rate) * No. Days left to maturity from rediscounting date Note: If the YIELD.METHOD is set to YES in the rediscount transaction, (ie) a discount to yield rate has been used, the effective straight rediscount rate would be derived and used in the above formula. The straight rediscount rate is to be arrived at as follows: Straight re-discount rate = Where d: number of days according to the base in the rediscount transaction (ii) If in the discount transaction, a discount to yield rate has been used, (ie) Profit from re-discounting = (Original Bill Transaction Amount (from first transaction)* yield Rate (from first transaction) Bill Transaction amount (from re-discount transaction) * yield rate (from re-discount transaction))*number of days to maturity from rediscounting transaction /number of days in year according to common base. Note: If the YIELD.METHOD is set to NO in the rediscount transaction, (ie) a straight discount rate has been used, the corresponding discount to yield rate would be derived and used in the above formula. This rate is to be arrived at as follows: Discount to yield rate = Where d: number of days according to the base in the rediscount transaction (B) The setting of field INTEREST.BASIS in the discount and rediscount transactions It may happen that the INTEREST.BASIS used for the rediscount transaction is different from that in the discount transaction. In such cases, the interest rate used in the rediscount transaction is to be adjusted for the base in the discount transaction. The formula to be used is given below r = r * where: r - interest rate according to the base in discount transaction r - interest rate according to the base in the re-discounting transaction d number of days according to the base in the rediscount transaction d number of days according to the base in discount transaction D number of days in year according to the base of rediscount transaction D - number of days in year according to the base of discount transaction </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>

Once authorised this field cannot be changed. Mandatory input if a value in CHRG.CLAIM.DATE or CHRG.CODE. An override will be required if the charge amount exceeds 5% of the value in AMOUNT. Note: The above validations are in the case of charges input by the user. In the case of bill rediscounting transactions, this field is system writte.</p>
        <p>INT.COLL.METHOD</p>
        <p>If the value in this field is set to REPAY.AMT, i t would be possible to collect interest on repayment amount instead of amount accrued so far. Such interest could be collected for scheduled repayments or adhoc repayments. Example : A LD contract is input with the following features: Contract Particulars Value Date 1-Jan-03 Maturity Date 1-May-03 Amount 100000 Interest Rate 10% Interest Basis 366/360 P' Schedules 1-Feb-03 25000 1-Mar-03 25000 1-Apr-03 25000 1-May-03 25000 INT.COLL.METHOD REPAY.AMT For the above contract interest would be calculated and processed on P schedule date. System would calculate the interest liquidation amount as follows; a) On 25000 @ 10% for 31 days (215.28) to be processed on Feb 01, 2003 along with principal repayment. b) On 25000 @ 10% for 59 days (409.72) to be processed on Mar 01, 2003 along with principal repayment. c) On 25000 @ 10% for 90 days (625) to be processed on Apr 01, 2003 along with principal repayment. d) On 25000 @ 10% for 120 days (833.33) to be processed on May 01, 2003 along with principal repayment. Accounting Entries for the above contract would be as under; Cr Customer Account 100000 Dr LIVEDB 100000 Jan 01, 03 - Feb 01, 03 Cr P/L (Interest Income) 861.11 Dr Accruals 861.11 On Feb 01, 03 Dr Customer Account (Principal) 25000 Dr Customer Account (Interest) 215.28 Cr LIVEDB 25000 Cr Accruals 215.28 Feb 01, 03 - Mar 01, 03 Cr P/L (Interest Income) 583.33 Dr Accruals 583.33 On Mar 01, 03 Dr Customer Account (Principal) 25000 Dr Customer Account (Interest) 409.72 Cr LIVEDB 25000 Cr Accruals 409.72 Mar 01, 03 - Apr 01, 03 Cr P/L (Interest Income) 430.56 Dr Accruals 430.56 On Apr 01, 03 Dr Customer Account (Principal) 25000 Dr Customer Account (Interest) 625 Cr LIVEDB 25000 Cr Accruals 625 Apr 01, 03 - May 01, 03 Cr P/L (Interest Income) 208.33 Dr Accruals 208.33 On May 01, 03 Dr Customer Account (Principal) 25000 Dr Customer Account (Interest) 833.33 Cr LIVEDB 25000 Cr Accruals 833.33 If an ad-hoc repayment for 10000 were made (using AMOUNT.INCREASE field) on Mar 15, 2003, interest of 202.78 (@ 10% on 10000 for 73 days) would also be collected online along with the repayment amount. Interest amount for subsequent P schedule dates would be recalculated on the redefined schedule amounts. In the above example, if dues were not paid on Apr 01, 2003, instead of debiting the customer account PD would be created for 625, for MANUAL or SEMI-AUTOMATIC liquidation mode. For value REPAY.AMT in this field the following validations shall apply: i) I schedules or any other schedule type with a combination of I schedule like PI, IP etc., cannot be defined in LD.SCHEDULE.DEFINE. ii) Input would not be permitted in field INT.PAY.FREQUENCY. iii) LD contract cannot be a DEPOSIT, CALL, NOTICE, ANNUITY or COMMITMENT type contract. iv) S basis interest would not be permitted. v) Interest payment method for such contracts cannot be discounted. vi) No input would be permitted in field LAST.DAY.ACCRUAL. vii) If interest tax were applicable, the same would be applied on interest amount that is being collected only. xiii) 'B' and 'N' schedule would not be permitted. ix) Capitalisation of charge would not be permitted. x) Capitalisation of interest would not be permitted for such contracts. xi) xii) Once input and authorised, this would be a no change field. xiii) Backdated rate/spread changes and principal decreases would not be permitted beyond last Principal Schedule date. The default value for this field is NULL.</p>

In both the above cases the difference will be compensated for within the last accrual period thus agreeing with the user defined commission amount. Depending on the value set in LMM.INSTALL.CONDS in field S.BASIS.RATE.VAL </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1 -2 alphanumeric character of the form: A B C D E F S (Optional input. Default value = CURRENCY table value.) Input allowed for Loan and Commitment contract types only. Commission basis "S" valid for fixed rate contracts only. Commission basis "S" is prohibited for Call/Notice contracts. Principal schedules can be defined for the principal maturity event only when basis "S" has been specified. Once authorised this field cannot be changed. Commission basis "S" is prohibited for Commitment contracts if the value in LCU.CALC.BASE Commission basis "S" is prohibited for discounted contracts.</p>
        <p>COMM.DUE.DATE</p>
        <p>Indicates next commission due date and associated frequency code for contracts where schedules are not defined through LD.SCHEDULE.DEFINE and where principal repayment is bullet in nature In case of call/notice contracts, the system will produce a single schedule for the first period. Upon reaching the scheduled event date a subsequent schedule will be generated based on the values in this field. In case of fixed maturity contracts, schedules are generated up to maturity of the contract. Example: a) 31 MAR 1986 M 01 31. M = Monthly. 01 = at one monthly intervals. 31 = the last day of the month. which represents a monthly end date. b) 31 MAR 1986 M 03 31 M = Monthly. 03 = at three monthly intervals. 31 = the last day of the month. which represents a quarter end date. c) 31 MAR 1986 M 01 10 M=Monthly, 01 = at monthly intervals 10 = 10 d) M01 e) 31 MAR 1986 W , where W= weekly. In this case, the first schedule would fall on 31 f) 31 Mar 1986 BSNSS, where BSNSS = every business day. In this case, the first schedule would fall on 31 g) The values defined in the EB.FREQUENCY table will also be accepted in this field. The value so input will be In case of Call/Notice contracts, if there is no input in this field, the total commission amount would not be calculated. Accruals would however take place at the commission % defined till maturity of the contract. </p>

        <p>COMM.PAYMT.METHOD</p>
        <p>Indicates if the commission has to be paid in advance or in arrears, or if commission is payable by the bank in arrears. On an interest bearing contract the commission accrues on the face value of the contract. At maturity the value of the contract will equal the principal value + interest + commission On a discounted contract the commission is taken at the start of the transaction. At maturity the value of the contract will equal the principal value + interest only. On a commission payable contract the commission accrues on the face value of the contract. At maturity, or commission scheduled payment date, the customer of the loan will be credited with the commission amount. The following values have been defined: '1' = Interest bearing contracts For a one period contract, the commission will be collected on the maturity date. For contracts with various commission schedules, the commission will be collected in arrears on the scheduled commission maturity dates. '2' = Discounted basis contracts The discount deducted in advance is reported as unearned commission. The discount is accrued on a straightline basis during the life of the contract. For contracts with various commission schedules the commission will be collected at the inception of each scheduled interest period. In this case, if no payment is received, the user will always liquidate the next discounted interest due against a receivable or transit account. After final maturity, the system will automatically change the 'discounted' payment type to 'interest bearing' payment type. Discounted contracts will be converted to interest bearing if principal is outstanding on the maturity/event date. Any future accruals will be handled on an interest bearing basis however the current portion will remain on a discounted basis. Commission Payable Contracts For a bullet (one period) contract, the commission will be paid on the maturity date. For contracts with various commission schedules, the commission will be paid in arrears on the scheduled commission maturity dates. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>

        <p>ASSET.CLASS</p>
        <p>Indicates the asset classification for the contract. If the contract is eligible for Provisioning, system updates this field during COB according to the rules stated in ASSET.CLASS.PARAMETER. Allows Manual input as well (by changing PROVISION.METHOD field to MANUAL) to override the System classification. Accounting entries would be raised online in accordance with the new asset class. When PD exists for the contract, asset classification should match the Classification in the corresponding PD contract. </p>

        <p>COMMIT.DRAWING</p>
        <p>Specifies whether for commitment contracts, Loans are allowed to draw from the facility. Commitment contract may be recorded by the system but may never be linked to a Loan. In these cases the amount may be managed manually by performing principal increases and decreases, or defining a schedule for the notional principal amount. When this field is set to NO, principal schedules may be defined for the commitment contract. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> Only allowed for commitment contracts (category 21-095 to 21-099). Cannot be set to NO if a Loan is already linked.</p>
        <p>COMMITMENT.NO</p>
        <p>The reference number of the Commitment contract. Indicates the reference number of the Commitment. It is this field which establishes the linkage of a loan or deposit contract (drawdown) to a Commitment. There are two types of Commitment contracts, a liability type which can have linked deposits as drawings; and an asset type which can have linked loan contracts. Upon a Commitment reaching its maturity date any unused commitment balance will be reset to zero. If COMMIT.DRAWING is set to NO no drawdowns can be linked. Once a drawdown is linked to a Commitment it will not be possible to reverse the Commitment; it will need to be early matured. Early maturity of this Commitment will require an override. If the Commitment is early matured any Loan or Deposit contract tied to such a Commitment will operate independently thereafter. </p>

        <p>Indicates the amount available under this Commitment. The value in this field indicates the Available or Unused amount remaining on this Commitment contract. At no time can this be a negative value. If multiple tranches were defined - The first updation would be for value in the corresponding TRANCHE.AMT field for the first D.D.START.DATE. The field would continue to get updated as and when there are loan drawings. When the next D.D.START.DATE is reached, depending on the value in L.C.U.TYPE, either the second TRANCHE.AMT would be written or the residual of the earlier tranche(s) would be aggregated with the new tranche amount and written For LCU.TYPE values R &amp; N, value in this field would get reversed out on the D.D.END.DATE of the last tranche, if REV.CONTINGENT were flagged to DED. </p>

        <p>CONTRACT.GRP</p>
        <p>Allows particular groups of contracts to be identified. For example all fixed term deposits over a certain equivalent value in a particular currency. The conditions which define a particular group are defined using the APPL.GEN.CONDITION Application or LD.GROUP.CONDITION. Each time the contract is changed the conditions are re-evaluated which can result in a new CONTRACT.GRP code. This code can be defined in the TAX.TYPE.CONDITION application to refer to a particular tax code, in conjuction with the relevant customer group conditon. If the CONTRACT.GRP changes then this may well result in new codes being allocated to the relevant TAX.PRINCIPAL.KEY, TAX.INTEREST.KEY and TAX.COMMISSION.KEY fields being updated. </p>

        <p>A unique reference number which identifies a particular contract. Contract numbers can be generated either a) manually or b) automatically. For automatic generation the appropriate indicator must be set by the system supervisor. Where automatic generation is supported depression of the F3 key at the "Awaiting ID" prompt supplies the next contract number. In instances where manual number generation is followed, the sequence number is the only mandatory data element. The system will supply the remainder based on the current application date. </p>

For a BULLET contract the only events are initial drawdown and maturity. There are no other scheduled events (apart from payments linked to the drawdown and maturity). A contract of this type will be entered using AUTO.SCHEDS set to YES. An AMORTising contract has other scheduled events aparat form initial drawdown and maturity. Other events will be defined using the LD.SCHEDULE.DEFINE application, invoked by DEFINE.SCHEDS set to YES. A contract may be changed from BULLET to AMORTising, or vice-versa by changing the definition of the AUTO.SCHEDS and DEFINE.SCHEDS.fields. Change from AMORT to BULLET requires an override, overrides are given whenever schedules are redefined. This field is set at authorisation depending on the value of AUTO.SCHEDS and DEFINE.SCHEDS. </p>

When a LD schedule is processed, there can be cases when only a portion of the dues get liquidated into the account and the balance written to PD ( USE.AVBL.FUNDS flagged to YES in PD.PARAMETER). If there is user defined rate in SETTLEMENT.RATES file, the entire liquidation (Account &amp; PD) would happen at this rate.

        <p>INT.LIQ.ACCT</p>
        <p>Contains the account number where entries are made for the reimbursement of the Interest (together with any taxes applicable to that interest) at liquidation. The defaulting process looks firstly at the SEC.ACC.MASTER record using the portfolio no. If no default found uses the CUSTOMER.CCY.ACCT record and finally if still no default found takes details from the AGENCY record and NOSTRO.ACCOUNT table. These settings can be overriden by using ACCOUNT.PARAMETER to set the account default method. In a case where interest is subject to taxes, such taxes will always remain associated with their interest amount and will always be liquidated through the same account. Thus it is not possible to liquidate interest and corresponding taxes through two different accounts or in two different currencies. Input in this field will be necessary only when the disposal of the interest is different from the disposal of the principal. If the account through which delivery is to be made is not known the User can choose to enter one digit (from 1 to 9) which will identify the text (defined in LMM.TEXT) to be printed on the advices sent to the customer. This will result in the funds being applied to an interim account in the applicable currency. This field may be changed at any time during the life of the contract; such changes will not be retrospective. Effective T24 release G12.1, input of an account denominated in a currency other than the deal currency is also permitted. In this manner proceeds for settlement may directly be drawn down from/to an account denominated in any currency. In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg. Customer.id in MONEYMARKET,Counterparty in FOREX, etc.) has a record in CUSTOMER.SSI application, then the account number in this field gets defaulted as per the definition for that Customer from CUSTOMER.SSI.For more information on the usage of this feature please refer to CUSTOMER.SSI application. </p>

        <p>DD.FEE.AMT</p>
        <p>Identifies the adjustment fee/expense amount. This field forms part of a multi-valued set of fields which allow adjustment fees/expenses to be entered onto a Loans and Deposits contract. The associated charge/commission/charge condition code is defined in the field DD.FEE.CODE. If a % symbol is entered the amount is calculated as the entered percentage of the AMOUNT. This field defaults to the associated charge/commission/charge condition type default amount as specified on either the FT.CHARGE.TYPE, FT.COMMISSION.TYPE or LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS tables respectively. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1-19 numeric characters (standard amount field). (Optional input. Default = See details). Mandatory input should the associated DD.FEE.CODE be entered.</p>
        <p>DD.FEE.CODE</p>
        <p>Identifies the charge (FT.CHARGE.TYPE), commission (FT.COMMISSION.TYPE) or charge condition (LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS) type. This field forms part of a multi-valued set of fields which allow adjustment fees/expenses to be entered onto a Loans and Deposits contract. The amount of the fees/expenses are defined in the associated field DD.FEE.AMT. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1-6 numeric characters. (Optional input). Mandatory input field should the associated DD.FEE.AMT field be entered. Must be a valid charge, commission or charge condition type code. If the input is of a LMM.CHARGE.CONDITION type then it must be of a payable type, i.e. the field PAY.RECEIVE on the corresponding LMM.CHARGE.CONDITION file must be set to "PAY". This is a NOCHANGE field after drawdown.</p>
        <p>AMOUNT</p>
        <p>The principal amount of the contract. In order to facilitate the efficient entry of the amount, an input feature has been provided which allows for the suppression of trailing zeros. e.g. INPUT VALUE 1T 1,000.00 2M 2,000,000.00 4.5B 4,500,000,000.00 The user may also input commas to assist in the entry of large amounts, the system will ignore their use and implement the amount based on the numeric input. This field will include the impact of principal increases (or decreases for Commitment contracts) plus the effect of capitalised interest. It therefore provides the user with a record of the maximum liability in relation to this contract. In the case of Syndications this field indicates the liability of the counterparty to the user and not to the syndicate as a whole. In case of Deposit type contracts with value in Mat.Amount field, the system calculates the amount and populates the value in this field. The user may, if required, modify the system calculated amount either upwards or downwards. While doing so the system performs a tolerance check on the amount entered by the user based on the settings in LD.TXN.TYPE table for the relevant category code. The tolerance check could be either as a percentage on the system calculated amount or as an absolute amount on the system calculated amount. Beyond the permitted tolerance level an error message would be indicated. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1-14 numeric characters plus a decimal point and commas. (Mandatory input. Multivalue field.) Value must be greater than Zero, unless SYNDICATE.AGT bears a value of "AGENT". Multiple amounts can be input for Commitment Contract types only. If the contract is linked to a commitment the amount must be less than or equal to the available amount indicated in COMMT.AVAIL.AMT. If linked to a commitment the value must be a multiple of D.D.MULT.AMT. Once the contract has been authorised this field cannot be changed.</p>
        <p>OVERRIDE</p>
        <p>Contains all the override messages which the user has confirmed during input. At validation,the system may generate a series of screen override messages to indicate some anomaly within the transaction (e.g. maturity date is not a working day for this currency). User may change the data or override the message. If the contract is subsequently displayed or printed, all override messages are shown. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>

        <p>INT.PAYMT.METHOD</p>
        <p>Indicates if the interest has to be paid in advance or in arrears. On an interest bearing contract the income or expense accrues on the face value of the contract. At maturity the value of the contract will equal the principal value + interest. On a discounted contract the income or expense is taken at the start of the transaction. At maturity the value of the contract will equal the principal value only. The following values have been defined: '1' = Interest bearing contracts For a one period contract, the interest will be collected/paid on the maturity date. For contracts with various interest schedules, the interest will be collected/paid on the scheduled interest dates. '2' = Discounted basis contracts The discount deducted in advance is reported as unearned/unpaid interest. The discount is accrued on a straightline basis during the life of the contract. For contracts with various interest schedules the interest will be collected/paid at the inception of each scheduled interest period. In this case, if no payment is received, the user will always liquidate the next discounted interest due against a receivable account. After final maturity, the system will automatically change the discounted payment type to interest bearing payment type. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1 numeric character of the form: 1 = Interest bearing. 2 = Discounted. (Optional input. Default value = 1) For discounted contracts the revision schedules must always coincide with an interest and/or commission schedule. The Interest rate type must be FIXED for discounted contracts. Discounted method prohibited for Call and Notice contracts. Once the contract has been authorised, this field cannot be changed. The discounted method is prohibited for Commitment contracts. Input in this field prohibited for Accounts Receivable and Sundry contract types. For discounted contracts the liquidation code must be "1" fully automatic. For discounted contracts the rate must be greater than zero. For Deposit type contracts with value in Mat.Amount Field only Discounted method is prohibited. If the field Yield is flagged to Yes only Discounted method is allowed.</p>
        <p>DEFINE.SCHEDS</p>
        <p>If "yes", upon validation the system will automatically take the user to the schedule define screen where interim schedules can be defined manually or semi-automatically. The user will have to specify the scheduled actions which are to occur over the life of the contract. Such actions can include principal, interest, commission, fees, margin revisions, rate revisions or diary actions. The aforementioned actions are not restricted to inception or maturity events. In the case of participating Syndications the values within the schedules represents the users (00) portion only; the syndications portions are computed based on these values and the percentages indicated within the syndication fields of the contract. For Syndications where the user is a non participating agent the values defined within the schedules represent the Syndication as a whole. Upon responding YES to DEFINE SCHEDS and validating the contract the system will take you to the following input screen: :LOANS DEPOSITS TESTING LD.SCHEDULE DEFINE 111 : :222 333 444 555 666 : :777 INT: 888 COM:999 : :: :FORWARD.BACKWARD KEY:A1 BASE.DATE KEY:B1 : :SCH DATE AMOUNT/DIARY ACTION RATE CHRG NO FREQ: :C1 C2 C3 C4 C5 C6 C7: : : : : : : : : :: Where the following 9 items are supplied by the system: 111 = Contract number. 222 = Currency mnemonic. 333 = Amount of contract. (or Principal to be re-defined inclusive of forward dated principal increases) 444 = Start date of contract. 555 = Maturity date of contract. 666 = Payment method and category. 777 = Customer mnemonic. 888 = Interest rate type and interest basis. 999 = Commission rate type and commission calculation method. The following information has to be input by the user: A1 = forward/backward key where: 1 = forward 2 = backward 3 = fwd same month 4 = not automatic(default) When the user wishes the system to generate a series of schedules automatically this code will indicate the response if the derived day is a non-working day. If the derived day is a non working day the system response will be: 1 = forward The system will go forward to the next working day. 2 = backward The system will go backward to the last working day. 3 = fwd same month The system will go forward to the next working day provided it is within the same month. If it is not within the same month the system will go backward. 4 = not automatic The user must specify each and every event date. If non-working days are specified the system will prompt for overrides. B1 = base date key where: 1 = base 2 = previous 3 = not automatic (default) This code indicates to the system how the future event dates are to be computed. 1 = base The system will use the first scheduled date entered to compute the subsequent event date(s). 2 = previous The system will use the last computed schedule date in order to compute the subsequent event date. 3 = not automatic The user will enter each and every event date. This option is only valid if the forward/backward key = 4 not automatic. C1 = schedule type i.e. "P" = principal "I" = interest "C" = commission "R" = revision "M" = margin "F" = fees "D" = diary "S" = settlement (system) "A" = advice (system) Not all codes are allowed ie Commitments cannot have principal repayment or margin amendments. Combinations are allowed where the schedule is valid for the components ie principal and interest. C2 = schedule event date ie . DDMMM DDMMMYY DDMMMYYYY DDMMYY DDMMM DDMM YYYYMMDD DD This is the end date of the first period and the starting date for the next/all subsequent events. C3 = amount of schedule or diary narrative. This field indicates the amount of an action or the appropriate diary narrative. An amount can be up to 14 characters plus a decimal point; diary narrative is 35 characters per line. C4 = the revision rate. This relates to the revision rate for either the interest or margin components. C5 = charge code. A valid charge code as defined on the CHARGES table. This field relates to fees and the fee currency will always be in the currency of the contract. C6 = number of scheduled events to occur. This field indicates the number of subsequent scheduled events that are to occur. C7 = frequency of the form nnnD = daily nnnM = monthly nnnQ = Quarterly nnnS = semi annually nnnA = annually with nnn = 1 to 999 and indicates the period between schedule event i.e. 4 D = every four days. Considerations for Syndications. When the user is "AGENT" and a participant the screen definition will relate to the participating agents share (type 00). The remainder of the syndicate detail will be computed based on the percentages indicated on the contract. When the user is "AGENT" and not a participant the screen definition relates to the syndicate definition as a whole (type 99). </p>

        <p>DELIVERY.INFO</p>
        <p>The production of advices in LD is controlled by the LMM.ADVICES application, where the advice format required can be set for all advices, or by application and/or Format Category code. Standard delivery messages are set up in the DE.MESSAGE application and are mapped by the DE.MAPPING application and output via the various DE.FORMAT applications. When the handoff record is created it contains several sections which contain images of the underlying contracts as well as additional information. The layout of the handoff record is as follows: Record 1 contains the Default Delivery from MESSAGE.CONTROL when used Record 2 contains the underlying LD.LOANS.AND.DEPOSITS contract in most cases For some advices this is replaced by a payment details record like PAYMENT.ENTRY During overnight processing an account balances record is passed instead Record 3 contains additional information depending on the contract activity Overnight schedule details are passed in this record Record 4 Only ever contains additional information for special advices Record 5 Contains schedule details for redefined schedules Record 6 contains a copy of the contract, usually formatted for Swift Record 7 is an additional schedule array built from LMM.SCHEDULE.DATES and LMM.SCHEDULES The layout is as follows: In the case of changes made for the use of the Amount.Increase field, the following fields are used: 7.25 Original amount of the contract 7.26 Contract interest rate 7.27 Contract value date 7.28 Contract final maturity date 7.29 Contract total interest amount 7.30 Signed principal amount for this schedule In the case of a Deposit, an increase is positive, a decrease is negative In the case of a Loan, an increase is negative, a decrease is positive 7.31 Date of amendment Record 8 contains Rollover details where appropriate Record 9 is not use.</p>

These settings can be overriden by using ACCOUNT.PARAMETER to set the account default method. The account to be credited or debited on the appropriate value date. Should the account indicated be a Nostro then further input may be required in the appropriate fields listed below: PRIN BEN BANK 1 PRIN BEN BANK 2 PRIN ADDRESS BENEF PRIN ACCT If the account, through which delivery is to be made, is not known the user can choose to enter one digit (from 1 to 9) which will identify a text (defined in LMM.TEXT) to be printed on the advices sent to the customer. This will also result in the funds being applied to an interim account in the applicable currency. The system will default to the first current account of the customer for the contract currency. The account indicated in this field will be used as the default account in the remaining account fields if no further account numbers are specified. Effective T24 release G12.1, input of an account denominated in a currency other than the deal currency is also permitted. In this manner funds may be directly drawn down from/to an account denominated in any currency. In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg.

        <p>PENALTY.RATE</p>
        <p>This field is used to arrive at the penalty spread that will be calculated when the LD contract becomes PD and crosses the period specified in PE.SWITCH.PERIOD in the relevant PD.PARAMETER record. When such period has been exceeded, the difference between the value in this field and the interest rate on the underlying contract will form the penalty spread in the PD record. This rate will be applied on the outstanding amount in the LD contract (referred to as OP in PD.AMOUNT.TYPE). For example: LD Contract amount 1,000,000 First principal payment 100,000 Contract rate 10% Penalty rate 15% PE.SWITCH.PERIOD in PD.PARAMETER 2 days As a result of the above settings, 2 days after the first principal payment becomes PD (i.e effective the third day), the penalty spread will be applied at 5% (15%-10%) on the outstanding LD principal of 900,000. Once a PD contract is created with the first PD.BALANCE, all subsequent PD balances will source the (latest) penalty rate from the PD contract itself (irrespective of PD.PARAMETER setting). </p>

In such a case, the value in the PENALTY.RATE in the contract will take precedence over the value in the PD.PARAMETER record. Subsequent to the input in this field and authorization of the LD contract, if the PENALTY.RATE in PD.PARAMETER is deleted and replaced with a CONTRACT.METHOD setting, then, when the LD contract becomes overdue, the rate in PENALTY.RATE in the LD contract is ignored and the penalty spread (if any) is calculated according to the CONTRACT.METHOD in PD.PARAMETE.</p>

The Commercial Loans and Deposits Module automates the control, administration, accounting and management information requirements of both pre and post maturity processing on a Bank's Portfolio. A wide range of products are catered for and these may be classified into five generic groups:- A Commercial Loan An asset product which provides an extensive range of processing in relation to the physical extension of credit to a borrower. A Commercial DepositA liability product which provides an extensive range of processing facilities. A Commitment A product type which controls those instances where a contractual obligation to lend exists and/or the bank wishes to levy commitment fees based on usage etc. A Sundry Deposit A miscellaneous item due to a customer. A Sundry Loan A miscellaneous item due from a customer. The module has been designed to be as flexible as possible in managing the various products it covers, and automating as many functions as one would encounter in the typical Commercial Loans and Deposits Department of a Bank. It provides a comprehensive set of on-line enquiry facilities, operational, marketing and management reports which obviate the need for loan ledger cards and other types of documentation traditionally maintained manually. The system can if required process a transaction through its life cycle without any intervention from the user, alternatively, the user can opt for full manual control. All processing results in the automatic generation of payments, billings, chasers, contract/rate amendment documentation etc. The Bank has full control over the parameters associated with the life cycle of a transaction eg indicating the number of days after an event when the transaction is considered to be a past due obligation. Such parameters are specified in tables which can be amended at any time. The main features of the module can be described as follows:- Multi-Currency drawdown or liquidation. Contracts can be denominated in a currency different from that of the drawdown or liquidation accounts. Full control is always maintained in terms of Negotiable, User input or Default Exchange rates applicable to the transaction. Fixed Maturity and Call/Notice. The system processes both Fixed date and Call/Notice type transactions. Interest bearing and discounted loans and deposits. Both interest bearing and discounted contracts can be processed. These can be either single or multiple period transactions. Five days basis upon which interest/commission will be calculated. Five days basis currently exist within the system, these are as follows:- 360/360 366/360 360/365 366/365 Special basis. Five different interest types. The following interest types are employed offering a wide range of options for the way in which a bank will structure the interest component on a transaction:- Fixed Floating Base rate linked Periodic Automatic type Automatic Libor linked Periodic Manual type manual Libor linked Periodic Straight type manual libor linked Automatic or fully manual scheduling facilities for all the financial components. The scheduling facilities of the system accomodate either automatic or manual processing for single or multiple period transactions. Schedules can be defined for each of the following components:- Principal repayments Interest payments Commission payments Fee collections Revision rates Margin rates Diary events. Schedules are defined, on the input date for the appropriate events occuring during a contracts life. They may be changed individually, or collectively redefined at any point should the need arise. The schedule dates can be generated automatically by the system where they form part of a regular plan or can be input individually by the user when they result in irregular periods. Any combination of system generated and user input schedules is allowed. Automatic or manual liquidation facilities. The user can specify whether the system should automatically liquidate amounts due on each due date or await user intervention to manually effect the process. A further option exists which allows the liquidation of principal to be manual while all other components such as interest, commission, fees etc are automatically processed by the system. Local and Withholding Taxation. The module caters for the processing of local or withholding tax. Local tax is computed on any or all of the following components:- Principal Interest Commission Withholding tax on the other hand is computed solely on the interest component. The undermentioned four methods are employed and the system provides comprehensive facilities to track the Banks liability, the status in relation to outstanding receipts etc. "CN" Customer Net "CG" Customer Gross "BN" Bank Net "BG" Bank Gross Full post event and post maturity processing. Once an event has fallen due the user has the option of manually controlling the status, or allowing the system to control the status in accordance with parameters present on certain tables. Such parameters are specified by the Bank when implementating the system, they can however be changed at any time. The sequence of steps followed are as followed:- PAST DUE OBLIGATION "PDO" STATUS. Penalty accruals commence on either a financial or memorandum basis. NON ACCRUAL BASIS "NAB" STATUS. All financial accruals cease. Memorandum accruals continue. Interest, commission, fees etc, are written off or capitalised dependending on the Banks implementation decisions. WRITE OFF "WOF" STATUS. The principal is written off and the contract is archived.

            <p>   This field will hold a valid ID of EB.ACCRUAL.PARAM for the interest / commission / accrual calculations. </p>
            <p> Based on the definition of this field a contract can be configured to do the following, </p>
            <p> Include first day of the interest period and exclude the last of the interest period </p>
            <p> Exclude the first day of the interest period and include the last of the interest period. </p>
            <p> Include both first (only value date) and last day of accrual period.</p>
            <p> Adjust the principal increase and decrease effective dates for interest calculation and accrual calculation purposes. </p>
            <p> By default the field shall hold null in which case the system shall include first day of the interest period and exclude the last of the interest period. </p>

<field>ACCRUAL.RATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates a special conversion rate to be utilised in the</p>
            <p>conversion to local currency of the month-end interest and</p>
            <p>commission  accruals.</p>
            <p>Monthly Profit and Loss accruals will be computed for</p>
            <p>reporting purposes using this rate instead of taking the</p>
            <p>CURRENCY table middle rate.</p>
            <p>This rate will be applicable during the current status only</p>
            <p>of the contract. For penalty interest, the system will not</p>
            <p>consider the value of this field but instead take the middle</p>
            <p>rate as defined in the CURRENCY table.</p>
            <p>The accruals will still be computed and held in the contract currency.</p>
            <p>Changes can be effected at any time during the life of the</p>
            <p>contract, but will impact future accruals only.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>1-10 numeric characters plus a decimal point of the form:</p>
            <p>999999.9999  (Optional input)</p>
            <p>An override will be required if the value in this field is</p>
            <p>outside the tolerance indicated on the CURRENCY table.</p>
            <p>Input must not exceed a tolerance of 25%.</p>
            <p>Input in this field is allowed only if the currency of the</p>
            <p>contract is different from local currency.</p>
            <p>Input must be a positive value.</p>
