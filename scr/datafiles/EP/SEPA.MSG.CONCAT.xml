            <p>This ‘L’ type application is automatically updated by both inward and outward treatments. </p>
            <p/>
            <p>   Its aim is to record the relation between a message Id and the related processed file history.  </p>
            <p/>
            <p>   Its key concatenates some choosen tag elements from the XML message sequences that have to be defined by inputing MNEWn in associated FIELD.EXTRCT of SEPA.LAYOUT and/or SEPA.HEADER.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>   E.g.: Operation nature + Instructing agent BIC code + Issuer message reference</p>
            <p/>
            <p>   The SEPA.MSG.CONCAT key is recorded in the first multi-value of field HIST.MSG.ID of the concerned transaction archive file (either SEPA.INWARD or SEPA.OUTWARD). </p>
            <p/>
            <p>   For a message related to an initial one, its key is calculated from the tag elements defined by inputing MOLDn in associated FIELD.EXTRCT of SEPA.LAYOUT and SEPA.HEADER.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>   If the initial record is not found, the override message “Original message Id is missing” is issued and the record is created. The SEPA.MSG.CONCAT Id of the previous message, if any is recorded on the 2nd multi-value of field HIST.MSG.ID of the concerned transaction archive file (either SEPA.INWARD or SEPA.OUTWARD) allowing an history link between the transactions. </p>
            <p/>
            <p>   For each initial transaction, the record is created with the following content:</p>
