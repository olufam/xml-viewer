            <p>This parameter file  could be used to define the conditions for forming PM groups (Field: PM.GROUP.TYPE)  for T24 applications which would be linked to PM processing through the generic interface. It would be possible (using the application PM.GROUP.TYPE) to map the fields of an application to PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY fields, for each PM group defined here. </p>
            <p />
            <p>For example, </p>
            <p />
            <p>For the application DX.TRADE related to PM through generic interface, a record could be created in this Application  with ID 'DX.TRADE'. Conditions could be defined in this application to form the PM Groups for the application DX.TRADE. </p>
