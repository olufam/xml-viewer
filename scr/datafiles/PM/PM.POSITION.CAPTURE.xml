            <p />
            <p>  This mini application allows the user to update the Position Management system directly without generating any accounting entry.  In other words, it enables the user to introduce movements deriving from transactions not supported by the applications currently available in T24 or from other third party or manual systems. </p>
            <p>  This is the case, for example, for products such as Interest Swaps, or options for which, today, there is no automated module available in T24. </p>
            <p>  Great care must be exercised when updating the Position Management module with this facility because all data is exclusively under the sole user control. </p>

<field>EXCHANGE.RATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the exchange rate associated with the movement. </p>
            <p>  When the user wants to update a currency position type, it is obvious that an exchange rate should be input in this field when the movement is entered. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>  Standard rate format</p>
            <p>  Either a value must be entered in this field or the next field INTEREST.RATE.</p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

<field>POSITION.ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the ID of the position which the user wishes to update.  It must refer to one of the Positions defined on the "PM.POSN.REFERENCE" file. </p>
            <p>  The fact that the position ID is part of the details of the movement introduced entails that the user will need to create 2 or more movements in this mini application when the underlying deal/contract (such as Financial Future, IRS etc...) has an influence on various positions. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>  2 to 3 characters type "AA" Mandatory Input</p>
            <p>  Must be a valid record on the file "PM.POSN.REFERENCE".</p>

<field>PM.PRODUCT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the type of product which is generating this position movement. </p>
            <p>  The user should invent meaningful product identifiers such as, for example, </p>
            <p>                'FF' for Financial Futures               'IS' for Interest (rate) Swaps               'OP' for Options               etc. </p>
            <p>  Current product identifiers such as "MM", "AC", "LD" etc are refused because movements originating from these transactions should NOT be introduced by this mini application but instead will be generated automatically from the deal/contract entered by the user in the relevant application. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>  Any 2 alpha characters type "SSS" Mandatory Input</p>
            <p>  The product identification may not be an existing T24 application such as "MM", "FX", "LD" etc.</p>
