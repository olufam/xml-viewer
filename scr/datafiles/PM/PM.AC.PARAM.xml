            <p>PM.AC.PARAM</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>This table allows the user to define the parameters governing the rules for the handling of the cash accounts (Account application) in the Position Management module, and for the on-line update of accounts via all cash transfer applications, ie Funds Transfer, Teller, Data Capture, Money Market, Loans and Deposits, Securities, and Future Rate Agreements.</p>
            <p>The facilities available are -       -   The spreading over time of balances and transactions.       -   The allocation of 'actual' interest rate for account or to           allocate a special rate from the Parameter file.        -  Allocation of different Position Classes. The main factor for these facilities is the Category Code on the account. The balance spread and interest rate allocation can be varied at the currency and/or balance sign level.</p>
            <p>For the spreading of balances and transactions. The on-line transactions can be spread in the same way as the overnight balance or can be allocated to the value date on the transaction. It is possible when setting up enquiries etc, to extract on-line, transactions which have been spread for certain applications, while for other applications the actual value date is used. Maturity date movements from applications like Money Market are never spread.</p>
            <p>In a similar way to the Securities Application, it is necessary to specify these parameters by overall type of position as defined in the table 'PM.POSN.REFERENCE' (Gap, Cash-flow etc...).</p>
            <p>The file that is used during the on-line day is called PM.AC.PARAM.DLY.  This ensures that all on-line updates to the Position Management system are based on yesterdays PM.AC.PARAM records, so that any changes to the records in this file are not made until the end of day processing.</p>

<field>REVERSE.BALANCE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates if the OPEN.VAL.DATED.BAL from the ACCOUNT record is to be reversed for the purpose of calculating which spread group the position update is to be found at, ie. DEBIT or CREDIT.</p>
            <p>If this field is set to yes, then the accounts OPEN.VAL.DATED.BAL is reversed, so that the SPD.GRP.SIGN located for the purpose of spreading PM Movements will be the opposite to the true account open value dated balance.  For example if an account has an open value dated balance of CREDIT 3,000, and this field is set to yes then the SPD.GRP.SIGN located will be n.DEBIT, where n is the BAL/INT.SPD.GRP id.</p>

            <p>Where either there is a large volume of accounts with similar conditions and a lot of small movements i.e Savings accounts or Internal accounts i.e Capital Investment accounts  then an interest rate is entered in this field or a linkage to a Basic Interest Table is entered in filed 19.1.1 FLT.INT.RATE.

            <p>If this field is set to 'Y' and the fields PRD.INT.TYPE and FLT.INT.TYPE are not set then the interest rates to be applied are determined from either the ACCOUNT.CREDIT.INT or ACCOUNT.DEBIT.INT records for the account being processed.

            <p>The accrued interest amounts are spread across a range of calender dates as specified in the fields SPD.GRP.SIGN to FLT.INT.TYPE below. The field INT.SPD.GRP points to the group SPD.GRP.SIGN that the spreading parameters are defined in.</p>

            <p>Multi-language field allowing the user to specify a short description for the record he is creating.</p>

<field>POSITION.ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the 'ID' of the record i.e. the position ID (Gap, cash etc..) for which the user wants to define the parameters applicable for the handling of the account balances in this type of position.</p>
            <p>It is anticipated that there will be only two records on this file.  One for the cash position with a key of CAS and one for the interest mismatch with a key of GAP.</p>

<field>GROUP.KEY</field>
<desc>
            <p>If data is to be extracted from the CONSOLIDATE.ASST.LIAB table then the condition group is specified here. This condition group will then be used to determine a default rate from GROUP.DEBIT.INT or GROUP.CREDIT.INT  depending on the dign of the amounts extracted.</p>
            <p>It is possible that acounts from more than one condition group will be incorparated into the balance fields on a CAL record, so this field allows the most sensible group to be defined when arriving at an interest rate to be used in the PM enquiries.</p>

<field>FLT.INT.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Allows the user to assign a cost, by means of an Interest key, to all accounts pertaining to the category code range defined in the previous field.</p>
            <p>This field is normal left blank as is field 18.1.1 PRD.INT.RATE so that the actual interest conditions for the account can be used.</p>
            <p>Where either there is a large volume of accounts with similar conditions and a lot of small movements i.e Savings accounts or Internal accounts i.e Capital Investment accounts  then an interest rate is entered in the previous field 18.1.1 PRD.INT.RATE or a linkage to a Basic Interest Table is entered in this field.</p>
            <p>Input in this field will only make sense when the position ID refers to an Interest mismatch/gap/position type.</p>

            <p>This class is used when on line account movements are required to be spread across a range of calender dates as specified in the fields SPD.GRP.SIGN to FLT.INT.TYPE below.  The field BAL.SPD.GRP points to the group SPD.GRP.SIGN that the spreading parameters are defined in.</p>
