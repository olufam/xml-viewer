            <p>This file allows the user to request particular PM Reports. </p>
            <p>These reports can either be produced online by running this application using the 'V' (verify) function or as part of the end of day run. For the end of day run a request must have been entered onto this file and the record ID included in the data field of the Batch record for Position management reports. The Batch process record is EOD.PM.REPORTS and is run as part of the start of day processing when the Position management files have been updated by all of the overnight processing. </p>
            <p>At present the following types of reports can be produced -           Cash Flow report.           Gap position report.           Interest Sensitivity Report. </p>
            <p>The headings on these reports can be changed by modifying the following Static Text records -           For Cash flow report.           For Gap position report.           For Interest Sensitivity Report. </p>
