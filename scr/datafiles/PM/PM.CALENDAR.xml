            <p>Each 'PM.POSN.REFERENCE' record must be linked to a Calendar record, the purpose of the Calendar record is to provide the time splits by which information is to be grouped.  The near time periods are likely to be days whereas further out time periods will be months, quarters and years. </p>
            <p>It is recommended that a different calendar is used for each position. </p>
            <p>The calendar record GAP is a compulsory record as it is required for spread of "Account" data in the end of day routines. </p>
            <p>When a calendar record is updated during the day the changes do not take effect until the end of day run occurs. </p>
