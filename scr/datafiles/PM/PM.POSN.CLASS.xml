            <p>OVERVIEW PM.POSN.CLASS </p>
            <p>  The PM.POSN.CLASS file has been created to record all the activities which can be used to build different types of positions, (GAP, Cashflow, Forex etc).  Transactions from the various T24 Applications are divided into multiple activities, to each activity one position class ID will be assigned.  As such, the position class ID serves as a link between each activity and the various positions defined by the user in the table "PM.POSN.REFERENCE". </p>
            <p>  Some of these position class ID's have been predefined within T24.  This is the case for Data Capture, Funds Transfer, Money Market, Securities and Future Rate Agreement. </p>
            <p>  The position class ID's relating to the Account, Loans and Deposits, and Forex applications are table driven but at the moment specific values have already been defined and it is recommended to keep them. </p>
            <p>  The position class ID's to be used for the account activity associated with the contracts and transactions have certain parts of the ID predetermined. The fifth character is system controled whilst the third and fourth come from the data held on the PM.AC.PARAM file. </p>
            <p>  Position Class ID's can be set up for those activities which are required to be included in the different positions, but are not maintained within T24.  There is no predefinition of these items. </p>
            <p>  The current list of position class ID's for T24 applications is provided below. </p>
            <p>  Firstly, there is a list that gives a brief summary for each Position Class by application. </p>
            <p>  Then follows a further more detailed explanation for each recommended Position Class. </p>
            <p>  The third list is the recommended list of Account movement Position Classes by Application. </p>
            <p>  In the first two lists some Position Classes have 'aaa' and others have 'aa' this means that these Classes are for the Account movement activities. </p>
            <p>  For the Accounts application a set of Classes is given for ordinary accounts (i.e Non - Nostro) and a set for Nostro Accounts. Also, both Cash and Gap Classes are listed. If the same time spread is to be used for both Cash and Gap account movements then only one set need be set up. For the online account movements it is possible to break the movements down over time or not. To be able to do this extra Classes have been allowed for. See PM.AC.PARAM for further information. </p>
            <p>  The current list of Position Classes recommended for the T24 applications is as follows </p>

            <p>For very high volume activities it does not make sense to drill down to indivdual activities in PM enquiries for either operational or performance reasons. For example in a retail environment where there could be thousands of similar transactions per day in local currency. This indicates that for activies related to this postion class for the currency specified that the drill down option will be turned off. This field is associated with the SKIP.TXN.REF.PER field where the blocking of drill down can also be controlled by value date, or in fact by today plus the number of days indicated. For example we coudl block drilldown for all FT or teller activites in local currency value today.</p>
