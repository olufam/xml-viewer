            <p>This table  defines the parameters for generation of account  and forex  related position movements  in PM.TRAN.ACTIVITY, for modules/applications linked to PM Module through the generic interface.</p>
            <p>  For the PD module, this table defines which of the generic position types are applicable to it, and also defines for each position type an associated character that is used to identify any account  related movements.</p>
            <p>  For  the Data Capture, Funds Transfer and  Teller Modules, this table defines the Transaction Codes and defines the parameters for account  related movements and  also define the position classes for forex related movements in PM Module.  </p>
            <p>  For the above referred modules, there could be only one record at module level with IDs  viz. DC, FT, PD, TT for Data Capture, Funds Transfer, PD and Teller modules respectively.</p>
            <p>  For other applications in modules linked to PM through generic interface (i.e. Applications in modules other than FR, FX, LD, MM, ND, SC, SW), there could be one record per application in this table. For these applications, the account movement  parameters could be defined either for generic position types or for transaction codes. </p>

<field>POSN.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>For the record with ID equal to 'PD':   Defines the generic position type used to identify individual position movements. This must match the POSN.TYPE field defined on a STMT.ENTRY generated by the source application before an accounts related position activity is created. For example PD.AMOUNT.TYPE is used to define the POSN.TYPE associated with each PD accounting activity. This is then stored in the STMT.ENTRY generated for that accounting activity. If the STMT.ENTRY POSN.TYPE matches a POSN.TYPE defined in this field,  then a position activity wil be generated. This means that the information which goes into PM can be set up to suit individual requirements, by simply adding or removing the POSN.TYPE from this table. As long as the POSN.TYPE is set in the STMT.ENTRY it is possible to enter a new POSN.TYPE in this field and set PM to rebuild to regenerate activities retroactively.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  For new  applications linked to PM through generic interface (Applications in modules other than DC, FR, FT, FX, LD, MM, ND, PD, SC, SW, TT) either this field or the fields TRAN.CODE.START and TRAN.CODE.END could be used to identify the last character of the related account movement position class.  However, the definition of  Position Types would be effective only if they are supported at application level and populated in STMT.ENTRY. </p>

<field>ACC.MVMT.CHAR</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the last character of the five character position class generated for accounts type position activities. </p>
            <p>  Example for use of POSN.TYPE: A PD contract generates a STMT.ENTRY record which updates an account with a category code of 4500 which falls in the range (1000 to 4999) defined on PM.AC.PARAM for customer accounts, with a position class of PMASC. The entry has a POSN.TYPE code of PAM ( Principal at Maturity ). This code is matched with the 'PAM' POSN.TYPE of the PD record on this file with an associated ACC.MVMT.CHAR of 'M'. The Position Class generated will be PDASM, where 'PD' relates to the first two characters of the source application defined in the ID, 'AS' is derived from the relevant class on PM.AC.PARAM. 'M' is the value from this field.</p>
            <p>  Example for use of TRANS.CODE.START: A MG.MORTGAGE transaction  generates a STMT.ENTRY record which updates an account with a category code of 1001 which falls in the range (1000 to 4999) defined on PM.AC.PARAM for customer accounts, with a position class of PMASC. The entry has a TRANSACTION.CODE of 800 (Mortgage Principal Drawdown). This transaction code is matched with the TRAN.CODE.START and TRAN.CODE.END values (if defined) of the MG.MORTGAGE  record on this file with an associated ACC.MVMT.CHAR of  'S'. The Position Class generated will be MGASS, where 'MG' relates  to the first two characters of the source application defined in the ID,  'AS' is derived from the relevant class on PM.AC.PARAM and 'S' is the value from this field.</p>
            <p>  If no value is defined here, then the value of last character of the account movement position class would be taken from the position class defined in PM.AC.PARAM as explained above.</p>
