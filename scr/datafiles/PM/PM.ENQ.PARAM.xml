            <p>Each PM enquiry is defined by a parameter record on the PM.ENQ.PARAM file. Each enquiry references  a record on this parameter file via the enquiry record itself. Therefore once the format and layout of an enqiury has been fixed it can be copied and different parameter records used to give selective views of the data. </p>
            <p>This approach allows the user to modify the data content of the enquiries without any great knowledge of the enquiry system. </p>
