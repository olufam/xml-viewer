        <p> AZ ALL INE ONE SCHEDULES HIST FILE AZ.SCHEDULES.HIST All in One Account module enables the Banks to define Account based Loan and Deposit products. The loan/ deposit accounts opened under this module, based on a pre defined All in One Products, are different from the Contract based Loans and Deposits, in view of flexibility in operations, like a normal account. The schedules are for the purpose of reference only, and no actions are automatically performed by the system based on the schedules. Schedules are used for updating the limit, ADI and comparing the AZ account balance on scheduled dates, to arrive at the arrears or the redraw value. The file AZ.SCHEDULES is generated by the system automatically, based on the definitions given in AZ.ACCOUNT. Changes in Principal amount, Rate of interest, Term, or Frequency may result in Re scheduling, based on the value of Term Priority opted by the user, in AZ.ACCOUNT. Whenever, an existing schedule is rescheduled by opting the Term Priority, as explained above, the revised schedule is written in AZ.SCHEDULES and the previous schedule is written in AZ.SCHEDULES.HIST with a note explaining the reason for the Reschedule. A combination of AZ account number, date of reschedule and serial number is defined as the ID for AZ.SCHEDULES.HIST
