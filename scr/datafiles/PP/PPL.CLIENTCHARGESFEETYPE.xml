                <p>If this flag is set to Y against a particular Fee type then that Fee will always be taken if evaluated for a </p>
                <p>particular payment. Both conditional and unconditional fees can be marked as �Always apply�. When a conditional</p>
                <p>fee is marked so, then fee will be applied always if the condition is first met, if the condition is not met, </p>
                <p>then fee is not applied though the flag is set. For example, Phone confirmation fee is applied only if client has</p>
                <p> chosen for phone confirmation. In brief, this flag should be understood as �Include fee type always for </p>
                <p>unconditional fees and for conditional, include if condition is met�. In the table below always apply flag </p>
                <p>for Transaction Fee and Service Fee is set as Y which means that both these components should always be applied.</p>
