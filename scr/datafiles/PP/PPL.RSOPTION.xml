            <p>The R &amp; S options table gives the list of ranked R &amp; S options linked to a Contract Category. </p>
            <p>This table should be unique on the basis of Contract Category ID and ranking. Also, the Contract option ID should be unique. </p>

            <field>LeadTime</field>
            <desc>
                <p>Used to determine the soft cut-off time. The cut-off as retrieved from the channel cut-off table is subtracted by this lead time (and the lead time in client conditions) to come up with a soft cut-off time.</p>

            <desc>
                <p>Every Contract Category will have one or more entries for R &amp; S option(s). </p>
                <p>The order in which these R &amp; S options are evaluated is given by this ranking. </p>
                <p>Rank 1 is the highest priority R &amp; S option and 999 being the lowest.</p>
                <p>Duplicate ranks are not allowed.</p>

            <desc>
                <p>This field gives the party for which the PTY Contract is defined.</p>
                <p>The PTY Contract party can be defined as a BIC in which case it can be specified as a BIC4, BIC6, BIC-8 or BIC-11. </p>
                <p>The Party ID type for a BIC is B. </p>
                <p>A Party ID Type and Party ID can therefore be defined for example as – B BARC, B BARCGB, B BARCGB21 or B BARCGB2106P. (An Contract with a BIC-11 has a higher priority compared to an Contract defined at BIC-8. Similarly in terms of pririty - BIC-8 Contract &gt; BIC-6 Contract &gt; BIC-4 Contract)</p>
                <p>The Party ID can also be defined as a National Clearing Code (NCC). The Party ID type for a national clearing is N. A Party ID Type and Party ID can therefore be defined for example as - N SC200050</p>

                <p>The Party ID type for a BIC is B.</p>

            <desc>
                <p>This R &amp; S option gives the method to be followed to route the payment to its top credit bank.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>At a high level, the R &amp; S options can be classified into three different types.</p>
                <p>1. Channel – Here the payment is sent to the credit bank using the channel. For example, the R &amp; S option can be defined as EMZ; the payment is then routed to the credit bank using the EMZ clearing.</p>
                <p>2. Correspondent Relationship (LORO/NOSTRO/ACCOUNT) – Here the payment</p>
                <p>is sent to the credit bank using LORO/NOSTRO accounts. The ACCOUNT R &amp; S</p>
                <p>option gives the flexibility to define an account on which the settlement should be carried out. This account is provided in the R &amp; S option table in the ‘Option ID type and ID’ field.</p>
                <p>3. Routing Method (PREF, SSI, AGENT, PARTY) – Here the credit bank can be reached via another correspondent bank. In case of a PREF R &amp; S option, this new correspondent bank is given by the PREF table. For SSI, it is the SSI table and for AGENT it is the AGENT table that gives the new correspondent bank. For PARTY, the new correspondent bank is provided in the R &amp; S option table in the ‘Option ID type and ID’ field.</p>
                <p>The R &amp; S of type (1) and type (2) as mentioned above will go through</p>
                <p>channel level validations. For R &amp; S of type (3), a new correspondent bank is introduced. This new correspondent bank would go through R &amp; S tables from contract onwards and determine an R &amp; S option corresponding to the new correspondent bank.</p>

                <p>R &amp; S provides the following alternatives for them</p>
                <p>1. NEXT (N) The next available R &amp; S option under the same Contract Category is checked.</p>
                <p>2. ADVANCE (A) The due date is advanced. (Refer to the date processing on how this is carried out)</p>
                <p>3. REPAIR (R) The payment is routed to Repair for a manual review.</p>
                <p>4. Country (C) Switch to Country level Contract. Applicable only on a PTY contract. The Contract table is checked to determine the applicable CTY contract.</p>
