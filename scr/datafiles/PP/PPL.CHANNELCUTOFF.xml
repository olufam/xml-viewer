            <field>CutoffTime</field>
            <desc>
                <p>Specifies the time after which the channel cannot be used for routing payments on a given day. The value will be used in Routing &amp; Settlement processing and Dates processing to determine if a payment has passed cut-off time for a particular channel or not. Routing &amp; Settlement can decide to find alternative channel to settle the payment or bump the due date by 1 day so that it can be processed on next day. Action to be taken will be setup driven and defined in Routing &amp; Settlement. In case of incoming payments, CVD (Credit Value Date) is increased by cut-off shift and the payment is processed on the same day.</p>

                <p>When payments hub receives a payment in foreign currency which requires currency conversion, treasury might require some time to buy or sell the foreign currency from the market. FXShift ensures that treasury gets some time for this. This is applied on a transaction only when debit and credit currencies are different.</p>
                <p>If CutOffShift and SettlementShift are also specified, the days will be bumped further.</p>

                <p>In certain cases clearing takes a day or two to settle the payment before it can be available to the beneficiary. This holds true for OUR correspondents who are operating in another time zone and can process out payments next day only (JPY).
