    <overview>

            <p>This table is used to specify special condition or possible options for the clients and each condition is represented by a clientcondition id.  This table will be peeled off to determine the client condition id based on the characteristics of the payment. We can define the Client Conditions at various levels; at one end it could be very generic and can be defined at the product level so that all payments with that product will use those client conditions; on the other end these could be very specific to a particular client requirements and accordingly defined at the most specific level (Product/Source/Business Line/Client Id/ Account/Currency). This means that order in which Client Conditions are retrieved is very important. Peeling off mechanism is nothing but defining the order in which Client Conditions should be read. </p>
