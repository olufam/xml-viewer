            <p>This screen is used to store the contract information in the payments hub. </p>
            <p>Routing &amp; Settlement process can deals with two types of Contracts - Country Contract and Party Contract.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The Party contract is checked for the credit party in the payment.</p>
            <p>In a Party Contract, the bank specifies on how the payment should</p>
            <p>be routed and settled with the credit party. </p>
            <p/>
            <p>The Country contract is checked for the destination country of the payment. In a Country Contract, the bank specifies</p>
            <p>on how it wants to route and settle payments to be sent to a specific country.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Peeling Off order determines the order in which the entries within the table are prioritized.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>A record authorised in this screen will create or amend or delete a record in store tables PPL.CONTRACT, PPL.CONTRACTCATEGORY and PPL.RSOPTION. Here, PPL.CONTRACTCATEGORY and PPL.RSOPTION are child tables linked to PPL.CONTRACT.</p>

                <p>At a high level, the R &amp; S options can be classified into three different types.</p>
                <p>1. Channel â€“ Here the payment is sent to the credit bank using the channel. For example, the R &amp; S option can be defined as EMZ; the payment is then routed to the credit bank using the EMZ clearing.</p>
                <p>2. Correspondent Relationship (LORO/NOSTRO/ACCOUNT) â€“ Here the payment</p>
                <p>is sent to the credit bank using LORO/NOSTRO accounts. The ACCOUNT R &amp; S</p>
                <p>option gives the flexibility to define an account on which the settlement should be carried out. This account is provided in the R &amp; S option table in the â€˜Option ID type and IDâ€™ field.</p>
                <p>3. Routing Method (PREF, SSI, AGENT, PARTY) â€“ Here the credit bank can be reached via another correspondent bank. In case of a PREF R &amp; S option, this new correspondent bank is given by the PREF table. For SSI, it is the SSI table and for AGENT it is the AGENT table that gives the new correspondent bank. For PARTY, the new correspondent bank is provided in the R &amp; S option table in the â€˜Option ID type and IDâ€™ field.</p>
                <p>The R &amp; S of type (1) and type (2) as mentioned above will go through</p>
                <p>channel level validations. For R &amp; S of type (3), a new correspondent bank is introduced. This new correspondent bank would go through R &amp; S tables from contract onwards and determine an R &amp; S option corresponding to the new correspondent bank.</p>
