            <p>This system updated table is used to store the list of correspondent banks to which the bank is authorized to send a SWIFT message.</p>

        <t>
            <field>MessageTypeInclude</field>
            <desc>
                <p>Indicates message types for which the RMA is applicable.</p>
                <p>It can hold wildcards.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>To define an entry that includes authorization for all the Cat - 2 messages with the exception of MT204 and MT207, the 'Include message Type' would be stored with 2* and the 'Exclude Message Type' would be stored with 204, 207.</p>
                <p>Together with Message Type Exclude, it will give the messages for which the RMA is applicable.</p>

            <field>OverrideThroughUpload</field>
            <desc>
                <p>Indicates whether the record can be updated using an automated upload process in the payments hub.</p>
                <p>Possible values:</p>
                <p>Y – The entry is manually updated and can be overridden by the upload process.</p>
                <p>N – The entry is manual updated and the upload process should not override it.</p>
                <p>Any manually updated record in the RMA table is marked as manually updated. Subsequently, the upload process should not go on to rewrite these records with the contents of the upload file. A manually updated record has greater significance and therefore should not be replaced by the upload process.</p>
