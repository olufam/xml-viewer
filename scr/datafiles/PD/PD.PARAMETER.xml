                <p>This field together with STATUS.CHANGE are used to define which advice type is sent on a change of status. When the contract is set to the status defined in STATUS.CHANGE this ACTIVITY.CODE will be used.</p>
                <p>  The actual format of the advice depends on the contract type and application. This is controlled by the key to PD.ADVICES.</p>
                <p>  It is possible to specify custom formats for each ACTIVITY.CODE, the ACTIVITY.CODE+PRODUCT or the ACTIVITY.CODE+PRODUCT+CATEGORY.</p>
                <p>  For example: 101             Would be used for all contracts 102-MM          Would be used for all MM contracts 103-MM-21050    Would be used for MM contracts with Category of 21050.</p>

                <p>This field is to be used when the penalty spread on a PD is to be calculated automatically by the system without any input in the PENALTY.SPREAD field. If this field is flagged to YES, penalty spread is calculated as the difference between the value in PENALTY.RATE field (either in the PD.PARAMETER record or the underlying LD/MG record) and the interest rate of the underlying contract. This spread will come into effect after the period/no.of instalments specified in the PE.SWITCH.PERIOD have been crossed. The value in POST.GR.PS.CALC is used as the calculation base for penalty spread. If at any time the spread becomes negative due to changes in the interest rate in the contract or a rate change operation in the PD contract, then the penalty spread is truncated to zero.</p>

                <p/>
                <p>  The PD record changes status from PDO to NAB based on settings in NAB.PERIOD.INT &amp; NAB.PERIOD.SPREAD fields, which may be expressed in number of days. Once the record has become NAB, penalty interest and spread are suspended (not posted to P&amp;L but credited to Asset Type SP). CHANGE.STATUS field provides facility to switch the PD back to PDO status (in which case income may be recognised) on account of a partial payment that settles the NAB portion of the dues.</p>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p>  If CHANGE.STATUS were set to YES, after every repayment, the balance dues are compared with NAB.PERIOD.INT &amp; SPREAD settings in order to determine the record's status. The balance after such payment, if due within the number of days in NAB.PERIOD.INT &amp; SPREAD, would result in the record changing status to PDO. If dues were repaid in full the record status would be changed to CUR.</p>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p/>
                <p>  On change of status from NAB to PDO, any income suspended on the deal would be credited back to P&amp;L. Movement entries would be raised for the balance in the suspended income Asset Types (SP) to respective P&amp;L category. OVERDUE.STATUS field in the associated LD record would be updated with the new status.</p>

                <p>  For defining a CONTRACT.GRP code, a record for PD.PAYMENT.DUE should be created in APPL.GEN.CONDITION. A series of Customer group codes can be defined in this record, using CONTRACT.GRP field, and can be classified according to the decisions set by various criteria (user defined field specified in Standard Selection of PD as J descriptor, which may be used to link a decision field in CUSTOMER application, like SECTOR can also be used as decision criteria)</p>

            <desc>
                <p>Specifies that the interest rate for calculating penalty interest is to be defaulted from the underlying contract.</p>
                <p>  There are six values which may be entered in this field:</p>
                <p/>
                <p>  If the input is "1",then this means that only penalty interest will be calculated using the rate of the underlying contract.</p>
                <p>  If the input is "2",then this means that the penalty interest will be calculated using the rate of the underlying contract and the penalty spread will be calculated using the value defined in the PENALTY.SPREAD field. In this case input to the PENALTY.SPREAD field becomes mandatory. The penalty interest and penalty spread will be accrued separately. The default amount used to calculate penalty spread is the outstanding principal, however it is possible to define the amount used by using the PS.CALC.BASIS field in the same manner that PEN.CALC.BASIS is used to calculate the penalty interest.</p>
                <p>  If the input is "3",then this means that the penalty interest will be calculated using the rate of the underlying contract and the penalty spread will be calculated using the value extracted from the calculation MAXIMUM.LEGAL.RATE minus the rate of the underlying contract. In this case input to the MAXIMUM.LEGAL.RATE field becomes mandatory.</p>
                <p>  If the input is "4",then this means that penalty interest and penalty spread will be accrued together. The rate used will be the underlying contract plus PENALTY.SPREAD and the amount is defined using the PEN.CALC.BASIS field.</p>
                <p>  If the input is "5",then no penalty will be calculated or applied on the contract.The fields PEN.CALC.BASIS,PS.CALC.BASIS,PENALTY.RATE,PENALTY.KEY,PENALTY.SPREAD become no input fields when the input is 5 in this field.For AC parameter record, only allowed option is 5, meaning no penaltyis calculated on the contract.</p>
                <p>  If the input is " " (NULL), then penalty will be calculated at the PENALTY.RATE (field 26)  or PENALTY.KEY (field 27) + PENALTY.SPREAD(field 29).</p>
                <p>  For parameter record with ID as  MD or MD-.....(category), the only allowed option is " " (null). While creating a parameter with ID as MD or MD-... (category) itself, this field will come as a NO INPUT field with null value.  The field PENALTY.RATE or PENALTY.KEY should have a value for these records.</p>
                <p>  If the underlying contract has ZERO interest rate, then the PD record will use ZERO interest rate for the PENALTY interest calculations. The Exception log file will be updated reflecting this.</p>
                <p>  Input to this field is only allowed if there is no input made to the PENALTY.RATE field or to the PENALTY.KEY field.</p>
                <p>  Effective T24 Release G12.2, underlying contract rate would include SPREAD of the loan.  For example, a loan is input with a BASIC.INTEREST key of 1 (10%) plus SPREAD 2%. PD.PARAMETER has penalty spread of 3%. In this case PE would be reckoned at 12% and PS at 3 %.</p>

            <desc>
                <p>This field would enable the user to define the capitalisation cycle for Penalty Interest (PE). The amount that has been accrued in PE would get posted to Capitalised Interest (PD.AMOUNT.TYPE = CE) on the dates and frequencies mentioned in this field. Should the User desire to capitalise interest (charge penal interest on a base that is inclusive of prior period interest that is due), the PE.CALC.BASIS should include CE, Capitalised Penal Interest, also.</p>
                <p>  Capitalisation would be for amounts that have been accrued till yesterday and todays accruals would get posted to PE and PS as per standard T24 functionality.</p>
                <p>  Based on the repaid status on the PD record, movement entries would be raised for CE and CS also, in line with other ASSET.TYPES. While the PD is in OVERDUE status, the CE and CS would be kept in OVERDUECE &amp; OVERDUECS respectively. On change of PD status to NAB, movement entries would be raised by the system and the balances would be moved to NABCE &amp; NABCS. Effectively, since individual balances are maintained separately, it is possible to report capitalised interest and accrued interest in different lines in the General Ledger of the bank. In the RE.CONTRACT.BALANCES file also, CE &amp; CS values are captured separately.</p>
                <p>  When the PD changes status from OVERDUE to NAB, the reversal of interest (if so set up in the Parameter) from P&amp;L will be for the balance in PE and CE (PS &amp; CS). The balance in CE will be moved to NABCE and the accrual (PE) will be moved to respective SP Asset Type in line with existing T24 functionality.</p>
                <p>  If the CRF.BY.TYPE is set to NO in the SYSTEM record of the PD.PARAMETER, CE and CS would be clubbed together with other dues and stored under OVERDUEDB or NABDB depending on the repaid status of the PD. On the capitalisation date, balances in PE and PS would get moved to OVERDUEDB or NABDB.</p>
                <p>  The dates and frequencies in PE.CAP.FREQ &amp; PS.CAP.FREQ should match. Two separate fields are provided so as to facilitate having capitalisation on either component and not on the other, if so desired.</p>

The input can be either in terms of no of days (n), or no. of instalments (nI). For example, if input is given as 2, the system will interpret this as 2 days and penalty spread will be calculated by the system from the third day that payment is overdue. If input is given as 2I, then after the first two instalments become PD, the penalty spread calculation will commence. For purposes of definition, each PD.BALANCE is interpreted as an instalment.</p>

                <p>This field would enable the user to define the capitalisation cycle for Penalty Spread (PS). The amount that has been accrued in PS would get posted to Capitalised Spread (PD.AMOUNT.TYPE = CS) on the dates and frequencies mentioned in this field. Should the User desire to capitalise spread (charge penal spread on a base that is inclusive of prior period spread that is due), the PS.CALC.BASIS should include CS, Capitalised Spread, also.</p>
                <p>  Capitalisation would be for amounts that have been accrued till yesterday and todays accruals would get posted to PE and PS as per standard T24 functionality.</p>
                <p>  Based on the repaid status on the PD record, movement entries would be raised for CE and CS also, in line with other ASSET.TYPES. While the PD is in OVERDUE status, the CE and CS would be kept in OVERDUECE &amp; OVERDUECS respectively. On change of PD status to NAB, movement entries would be raised by the system and the balances would be moved to NABCE &amp; NABCS. Effectively, since individual balances are maintained separately, it is possible to report capitalised interest and accrued interest in different lines in the General Ledger of the bank. In the RE.CONTRACT.BALANCES file also, CE &amp; CS values are captured separately.</p>
                <p>  When the PD changes status from OVERDUE to NAB, the reversal of interest (if so set up in the Parameter) from P&amp;L will be for the balance in PE and CE (PS &amp; CS). The balance in CS will be moved to NABCS and the accrual (PS) will be moved to respective SP Asset Type in line with existing T24 functionality.</p>
                <p>  If the CRF.BY.TYPE is set to NO in the SYSTEM record of the PD.PARAMETER, CE and CS would be clubbed together with other dues and stored under OVERDUEDB or NABDB depending on the repaid status of the PD. On the capitalisation date, balances in PE and PS would get moved to OVERDUEDB or NABDB.</p>
                <p>  The dates and frequencies in PE.CAP.FREQ &amp; PS.CAP.FREQ should match. Two separate fields are provided so as to facilitate having capitalisation on either component and not on the other, if so desired.</p>

                <p/>
                <p>  If this field is marked to NULL - Subject to balance in the account being higher than the MIN.AUTO.PERCENT defined, the entire component of due that is re-tried (either by date, or by type, or by date and type) is settled and for any insufficient portion the account is overdrawn. Eg. MIN.AUTO.PERCENT is set as 50% and PD has a due of PR 10,000. Balance in the settlement account is 6,000. In this case the account would be debited by 10,000 (resulting in an overdraft of 4,000) and the PD would be settled.</p>

                <p>  If this field is marked to YES - Only the balance in the account would be considered for the purpose of settlement of past dues and the account would not be overdrawn forcibly during EOD on account of PD settlement. For the same example, if the setting was YES, the account would be debited for 6,000 (actual balance) and PD settled for that amount. After EOD, PD would have a balance of 4,000 that would be re-tried on subsequent days.</p>
