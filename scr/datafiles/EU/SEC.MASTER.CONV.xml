            <p>This application can be used as a utility program to create security master record automatically. The program will allow for the specification of a selection criteria in order to select securities that have identical rules for creation. The rules will be specified with the help of flags provided on this application that can be set to 'YES' or 'NO' indicating whether the program needs to automatically caary the value from the old record to the new record. The program will create new record in an unauthorised state. The old record/s will be changed and written to the unuthorised file as well. The user will need to authorise the changes in the old record before authorising the new records. Once the old and new record have been authorised the user can go ahead and re-denominate the old securities using corporate actions. In order to re-denominate the security the user will need to create new DIARY.TYPE record which will need to have the REDENOMINATION flag set to 'YES' </p>

<field>PROCESS.STAGE</field>
<desc>
            <p>The PROCESS STAGE allows to define which kind of process should be executed (See below). </p>
            <p>It has to be used in conjunction with the function "Authorise" which needs to be used to start a process. Note that once the process is executed, the PROCESS STAGE will automatically be set back to Null, to avoid to run a process twice. </p>
            <p>In addition,  it needs to be known that existing unauthorised records will be ignored. (They will be overwritten, which allows to rerun the process multiple times in case of error). </p>
            <p />
            <p>------------------------------ TEST PROCESS         : TEST ------------------------------ This process will only test the selection set up in fields FIELD.NO, OPERAND, FIELD.CONTENT. When starting this process, the system will update fields SELECTED.IDS, RESULT.IDS, RESULT.TEXT to report the result of the selection. (See Helptext for SELECTED.IDS for more information). </p>
            <p>------------------------------ PREPARATION PROCESS  : PREPARE ------------------------------ This process will : . Select Securities according to the selection rules; . Modify the existing Security master record, with the values indicated in the Local reference fields SM.METHOD, SM.RND.NOM, SM.RND.CSH, SM.RND.PVA, SM.MIN.UNI and SM.NEW.SEC. (It supposes that EU.PARAMETER has been setup to define the Local Reference number of each Local References). </p>
            <p>Note that a "Variant" of this process can allow to Ovewrite or not the existing values. (See field OVERWRITE.LOC.REF). </p>
            <p>------------------------------ CREATION PROCESS     : CREATE ------------------------------ This process will : . First, execute EXACTLY the same as the PREPARATION process; . Then, determine a new Security Number (using the "New Security number" of the local reference, or using the proposed Suffix, or using the proposed sub routine; . Then, duplicate the record (Old -&gt; New); . Then, store this new Security Number in the associated Local Reference in the Old Security; . Then, process the other requests on both records (KEEP.MNEMONIC, KEEP.TRADE.UNITS, KEEP.PAR.VALUE, KEEP.I.S.I.N., KEEP.SEDOL.NO, KEEP.EUROCLEAR.NO, KEEP.CUSIP.NO, KEEP.CEDEL.NO, KEEP.SWISS.NO). (See in particular documentation of KEEP.TRADE.UNITS and KEEP.PAR.VALUE). </p>
            <p>Note that all the records are then kept in IHLD mode, and need to be inputted and authorised (This can be achieved automatically by using EBS.AURO.FUNCTIon). </p>

            <p>------------------- EURO METHOD CONCEPT ------------------- Securities will be converted based on different methods, as follows :  HOLDING       : Bonds, the nominal will be converted based on                  the global value of the holding.                  Rounding rules are defined at the level of the                  field SM.RND.NOM and SM.RND.CSH, and the new                  trading unit is defined at the level of the                  field SM.MIN.UNI.  UNIT          : Bonds, the nominal will be converted based on                  an individual conversion of each trading unit.                  Rounding rules are defined at the level of the                  field SM.RND.NOM and SM.RND.CSH, and the new                  trading unit is defined at the level of the                  field SM.MIN.UNI.  UNROUND.PAR   : Equities, the New Par Value is obtained by                  dividing the Old Par Value by the fixed rate,                  with no rounding (6 digits precision).  ROUND.PAR     : Equities, the New Par Value is obtained by                  dividing the Old Par Value by the fixed rate,                  with rounding.                  The rounding rule (Legal, Down, Up) is defined                  at the level of the field SM.RND.PAR.  NO.PAR        : Equities, with no New Par value.                  This means that, implicitly, the New Par value is                  a fraction (Total emission / Total number of                  shares).  NEW.PAR       : Equities, with Renominalisation, which means                  that the New Par Palue will be provided by                  the company.                  In the same way, the ratios to transform the                  nominal will be provided.                  This implies the company to get the approval                  of shareholders, to transform the capital.                  This method will be used later in March 1999. </p>
            <p>------------------- LINK WITH DIARY ------------------- When processing a DIARY for a selected security, some automatic mechanisms can be set up to facilitate the input of the DIARY record. If the user uses a DIARY version where some fields are checked against the subroutine V.DIARY.EURO, the following fields will be automatically fed :  NARRATIVE : Built from the Method used.  NEW.SEC.NO: Picked up in the Local Reference of Security master.  OLD.RATIO : Fixed rate for Bonds, 1 for Equities  NEW.RATIO : 1 </p>
            <p> EVENT.TYPE : Built from the method and rounding rules, as               follows :                EU.BD.UNI.DN   : Bonds, Unit   , Round Down, No Cash                EU.BD.UNI.LG   : Bonds, Unit   , Round Legal No Cash                EU.BD.UNI.UP   : Bonds, Unit   , Round Up  , No Cash                EU.BD.HLD.DN   : Bonds, Holding, Round Down, No Cash                EU.BD.HLD.DN.LG: Bonds, Holding, Round Down, Cah LG                EU.BD.HLD.LG   : Bonds, Holding, Round Legal No Cash                EU.BD.HLD.UP   : Bonds, Holding, Round Up  , No Cash                EU.EQUITY      : Equity 1 to 1 (which supposes to set up the DIARY.TYPE records with this convention). </p>
