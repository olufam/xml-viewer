<field>CONV.LCY.SUSP.CAT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the internal account category code to be used for posting adjustment entries in the new local currency after the conversion of the base currency has taken place. </p>
            <p>  In order to maintain the integrity of the system, the local currency conversion process will ensure that the system is automatically adjusted. As part of the conversion process the following checks and processes take place: </p>
            <p />
            <p>  FOREX Contracts --------------- </p>
            <p>  Before the conversion takes place the foreign currency positions raised from current FOREX transactions are reversed, a revaluation takes place so that FOREX contracts have no impact in currency positions or unrealised profit and loss at the time of conversion. At the same time all accruals from current FOREX contracts with revaluation types of IN, IH and SL are reversed. </p>
            <p>  Once the base currency has been converted the positions from the current FOREX contracts are re-raised, together with accruals from IN, IH and SL contracts. All resulting P&amp;L will now be posted in the new local currency. A revaluation is again performed to ensure that the latest local value is recorded. </p>
            <p />
            <p>  Asset and Liability Currency Positions -------------------------------------- </p>
            <p>  Prior to conversion of base currency, the value of all Asset and Liability currency positions are recorded against each currency. These values are held in the fields AL.CCY, AL.POSN.BEF the corresponding local equivalent in the old base currency is held in AL.LCL.POS.BEF. </p>
            <p>  After conversion the position values are extracted again and stored in the fields AL.POSN.AFT, AL.LCL.POS.AFT (in new local currency). </p>
            <p>  In the case of the previous local currency, it may be necessary to adjust the currency position to reflect the impact of accruals of interest and commission and charges from transactions in the previous local currency. These transactions would not have had raised a currency position, but since they will be effectively foreign currency transactions once the base currency is converted, a currency position update is required. The amount of adjustment is recorded in the field AL.POS.ADJUST with the new local equivalent adjustment held in the field AL.POS.LCY.ADJ. The position record for DEALER.DESK 00 will be adjusted. </p>
            <p>  A similar situation arises with the new local currency, where positions may have raised, but are no longer required now the currency is local. </p>
            <p />
            <p>  CRB Balances ------------ </p>
            <p>  The asset and liability balances held in the CRB is recorded before and after the base currency conversion. This is held together with the currency in AL.CCY in the fields AL.BAL.AMT.BEF, AL.LCL.BAL.BEF (in previous local currency), AL.BAL.AMT.AFT and AL.LCL.BAL.AMT.AFT (in the new local currency). The foriegn currency value of the CRB asset and liability balance must always be equal to the asset and liability foreign currency position. The CRB figure is used to determine how much adjustment is required to the asset and liability foreign currency position for the new and old base currencies. </p>
            <p>  Before and after contingent balances are recorded by currency in the fields CONT.BAL.BEF CONT.LCL.BEF, CONT.BAL.AFT and CONT.LCL.AFT. </p>
            <p />
            <p>  P&amp;L Balance ----------- </p>
            <p>  The profit and loss balance of the system is recorded in the fields XXX. </p>
            <p />
            <p>  Balancing Entry --------------- </p>
            <p>  The total value of the Asset and Liabilities in local currency should be equal to the profit and loss value, both before and after the local currency conversion. Since consolidated values are converted there may be rounding differences which arise from this process when comparing the values before and after. </p>
            <p>  A check is made to ensure that the sum of asset and liability balances in previous local currency plus the profit and loss balance in previous local currency has the equivalent value in the new local currency when the same check is made. This value should normally be zero. An entry will be raised if the two values are not equivalent. </p>
            <p>  The entry is made to an account constructed as follows: </p>
            <p>  New Local CCY : Category Code (10000-19999) defined in this field : 0001 </p>
            <p>  The transaction code used for the posting is defined in the field XXXX. </p>

<field>AL.LCL.ADJUSTMENT</field>
<desc>
            <p>This adjustment amount in new local currency is posted to the suspense account for the category code defined in CONV.LCY.SUSP.CAT. </p>

            <p />
            <p>  System Total After is calculated as follows: </p>

<desc>
            <p>Specifies the default category for internal suspense accounts used when converting contracts from one currency to the fixed currency. </p>
            <p>  When a contract is converted from one currency to another, the existing contract in National Currency Unit (NCU) is early matured on the next interest payment date. The outstanding balance is converted to the new currency at the fixed conversion rate beginning at the next repayment date, maturing at the original maturity date. </p>
            <p>  The principal (and interest payment in some cases) must be liquidated through a suspense account, denominated in NCU with the category defined in this field in the format: </p>
            <p>             NCU : Category : 0001 </p>
            <p>  The new contract must drawdown via a suspense account of the same category to ensure that funds are 'washed' through between the 2 contracts. The drawdown account will be an account denominated in the fixed currency (e.g. EUR) with a key using the same category code: </p>
            <p>             EUR : Category : 0001 </p>
            <p>  For example: </p>
            <p>  Loan of outstanding balance: </p>
            <p>  1,000.00 IEP @ 10 %, with annual interest payments, next interest date 01/01/99, maturing 01/01/03 </p>
            <p>  Conversion to EUR required on 01/01/99 at rate of 0.796244 </p>

            <p>  An equivalent equal and opposite balance will reside in the IEP and EUR suspense accounts. If the IEP account is linked to the EUR suspense accounts using the AUTO.PAY.ACCOUNT this balance will was through the EUR account only and should net to zero. </p>

            <p>  The system date that the conversion process runs is controlled by entry of the NEXT.RUN.DATE in the batch EU.BASE.VERIFY. </p>

            <p>  The FIXED.START.DATE is 01/01/99. </p>
            <p>  If conversion is to take place so that the system is EUR from 01/01/99 the following should be entered. </p>
