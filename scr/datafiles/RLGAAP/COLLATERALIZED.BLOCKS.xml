            <p>This application contains, by Portfolio and Security, any active blocks that have been placed by the SC.BLOCK.SEC.POS application for the US Market. Whenever a BLOCK is placed on a security position, this application will be updated with the ID of the block that was placed.</p>

            <p>If a BLOCK is to be removed, this application will be used to verify and display to the user what blocks currently exist for that security position. Once the user has selected the block to be removed, the ID of the block will be removed from this application.</p>
