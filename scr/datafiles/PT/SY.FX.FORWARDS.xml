            <p>FX Participating Forward (PF) is an OTC contract to buy or sell the underlying currency periodically at a pre-fixed exchange rate. </p>
            <p />
            <p>A participating forward transaction allows the investor to </p>
            <p />
            <p>(i) Under a bullish structure, buy a pre-fixed amount of the underlying currency (the "Currency Amount") on each periodic settlement date at a discounted exchange rate of the currency pair (being set as the Strike Price) compared to the exchange rate of the currency pair on the trade date. </p>
            <p />
            <p>(ii) Under a bearish structure, sell the pre-fixed Currency Amount of the underlying currency on each periodic settlement date at a premium exchange rate of the currency pair (being set as the Strike Price) compared to the exchange rate of the currency pair on the trade date. </p>
            <p />
            <p>Provided no Knock-out Event has occurred prior to the expiration time on the last expiration date, an investor is obliged to buy (under a bullish structure) or sell (under a bearish structure) a pre-fixed Currency Amount of the underlying currency at the Strike Price on each settlement date. </p>
            <p />
            <p>TARKO - is an OTC contract which is similar to the Participating Forward.  The only difference is that the Knock Out barrier is not an exchange rate but rather the intrinsic value of the accumulated profits. In other words, the contract will get Knocked out if the intrinsic value of the accumulated profits reaches a pre - determined amount. </p>           
            <p />
            <p>These products being OTC products, the bank is acting as a principal. Typically the booking model would be as below : </p>
            <p>Client vs Bank's Own Book  - This is the client leg of the deal.</p>
            <p>Bank's own book vs counterparty - This is the street leg of the deal.</p>
            <p>These two deals are linked together by the field B2B reference. Both deals would have the same value in this field,  the system would then recognize these as linked deals.</p>
            <p>The field COUNTERPARTY.TRADE needs to be set to 'Yes' in the street leg, indicating to the system that this is the street leg.</p>
