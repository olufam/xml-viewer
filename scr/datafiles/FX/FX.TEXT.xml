            <p>FX.TEXT is a table of advice texts which will be printed on advices/ confirmations when settlement information in respect of a contract counterparty is not known. </p>
            <p>Nine fields are available within this table and each one will have a unique text which will be printed on the advice confirmation. The User will choose which text to print by keying a number between 1 and 9 at the appropriate account field when loading a contract. </p>
            <p>It may be the case, for example, that the branch has no information about the counterparty's payment instructions and is therefore unable to pay funds away because the destination of those funds is not known. In such a situation, the User would choose an appropriate text from the FX.TEXT table (e.g. Payment Instructions Missing) by keying a number between 1 and 9 at the appropriate account field when loading a contract. This message would then be printed automatically on the advice confirmation corresponding to the contract. </p>
            <p>Only two records can be created: </p>
            <p>         1) one for text related to payments and therefore having the key             equal to the FX Suspense Credit Category Code (see Account             Class). </p>
            <p>         2) one for text related to receipts and therefore having the key             equal to the FX Suspense Debit Category Code (see Account             Class). </p>
