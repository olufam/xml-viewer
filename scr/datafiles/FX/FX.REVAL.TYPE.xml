            <p>Within this table are defined the revaluation types available in the Foreign Exchange Application.  The system caters for five different Revaluation methods: </p>
            <p />
            <p>IN = Interest Method This method helps reflect the difference between interest rates in one country and those in another.  For example, a USD loan receiving 10% funded by GBP deposit paying 12% appears unprofitable.  However, the difference in interest rates will be reflected by the Forward Exchange rates.  The Interest method allows for this by offsetting any profit or loss against interest. </p>
            <p />
            <p>RB = Rebate method This method revalues a contract to reflect the cost of closing the bank's position on a 'buy back' basis.  For example, a three month forward purchase which has been in our position for one month would be revalued at the two month forward rate. </p>
            <p />
            <p>SL = Straight line method Using this method, the difference between the spot rate and the appropriate forward rate is amortized over the contract period.  For example, if todays spot rate gives an equivalent of GBP 100 and the one month forward rate GBP 130, the 'Premium/Discount' would be GBP 30. This would then be accrued at GBP 1 per day assuming a 30 day month. </p>
            <p />
            <p>IH = Interest/Hedged Method This method is similar to the interest method in that it reflects the difference between interest rates in one currency and those in another. However, it differs in that it assumes a hedging situation whereby the full amount of the foreign exchange deal is likened to an underlying loan and deposit.  Essentially, it applies the interest rates of the bought/ sold currencies not to the amounts of the contract but to a 'notional' amount which would then yield these contract amounts over the forward term of the deal. </p>
            <p />
            <p>SF = Straight line funding method This method is primarily for the Swap contract type and is similar to the SL method except that the premium/discount of a Swap is amortised over the contract period in the currency that the premium/discount arises. </p>
            <p>PM.PARAMETER needs to be changed to include the new position class - FXFSF if the SF reval type is defined. </p>

<field>FX.REVAL.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the revaluation methods that are available in the Foreign Exchange application.  The application handles four methods: </p>
            <p>            IN = Interest method             RB = Rebate method             SL = Straight line             IH = Interest/hedged             SF = Straight line funding </p>
            <p>If SF is defined then PM.PARAMETER table will need changing to include the new position class - FXFSF. </p>
            <p>In order that a revaluation can be used by the application, it must first be defined on this table. </p>
