<overview>
<ovdesc>
This file stores the matched message key. The reason to this is that when messages are matched in the CM.MESSAGE file the changed record gets written to the CM.MESSAGE$NAU file at unauthorised stage, therefore it is possible to have another message matched with the same key at the unathourized stage. With this index file we will have a  Common area to check the matched message key against and hence stop the user from entry of another duplicate match key.</ovdesc>
