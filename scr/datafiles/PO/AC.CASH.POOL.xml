<ovdesc>

            <p>The AC.CASH.POOL application is used to record 'rules' which will be checked against to see if a transfer of funds needs to be made from one account to another.</p>
            <p>The record id is an Account number, which is one of the Accounts involved in the transfer, it can be a feeder type Account when surplus type sweeps are defined (meaning any surplus is taken from this account and fed to another); it can be a fed account when a maintenance sweep is defined (meaning any shortfall is taken from the other account). It can also be both if the sweep type is a two-way type (meaning it will take funds when required or give funds - this is the same as a maintenance and sweep in one rule).</p>
            <p>The record is multi-valued so several rules can be applied to the record id Account. For example a daily sweep can be made to take surplus funds to a higher level Account on a daily basis, but at the end of each month the Account needs to maintain a certain balance for payments to be made.</p>

<field>LINK.ACCT</field>
<desc>
            <p>The account which with the source account (the cash pool key) has the sweep relationship. Depending on the rule entered ,  the 'link' (LINK.ACCT) will either debit or credit the source account. There are 3 basic types of sweep; the surplus, the maintenance and the two-way. Surplus sweeps will debit the 'source' account and credit the 'link'; maintenance sweeps will credit the 'source' and debit the 'link'; whilst two-way will debit the 'link' if funds are needed or credit the 'link' if a surplus is present.</p>

<field>RULE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This determines what type of sweeping will occur within the pool between the source account and the link account. The value entered is the id of an AC.SWEEP.TYPE record which is user configurable, the actual type is set within that record. However, they must be based on one of four types of rules used within cash pooling:</p>
            <p>MAINTENANCE</p>
            <p>If the source account balance falls below the specified amount in the minimum amt field then the link account is debited and the source account credited with the amount required (subject to user controlled conditions) or with the funds available.</p>
            <p>SURPLUS</p>
            <p>If the balance in the source account is above the amount specified in the  maximum amt field then the surplus is debited from the source account and credited to the link account.</p>
            <p>TWO-WAY</p>
            <p>This is like a combination of the two above. First the balances are checked for a maintenance sweep. If the specified balance is not below the minimum amount then it will then be checked for a surplus amount.</p>
            <p>CASHFLOW</p>
            <p>A cash flow type rule will only occur between those accounts linked to the   main master account. It is similar to the two way rule but with a restriction   on the amount of money that the Main Master (MM) account can pass down to the   account below it. Basically when a pool is being set up a limit will be set on   the maximum amount that the main master will pass down. This is held in the   CASHFLOW.AMT field. There is an additional check on how much money has been   passed up to the MM. This running total of monies transferred is held in the   AGREGATE.BAL field. The available amount is the net of the CASHFLOW.AMT and   AGREGATE.AMT fields.</p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <p>A cashflow limit of USD 100,000.00 is set in field CASHFLOW.AMT. The link account is credited today with USD 50,000.00 and is automatically transferred up to the higher level account. On the next day the fields will show:</p>
            <p>CASHFLOW.AMT     100,000.00</p>
            <p>AGREGATE.BAL        50,000.00</p>
            <p>This means that the amount that can be taken to cover shortfalls is now USD 150,000.00 i.e. the net amount of the two fields. The next transaction causes an overdraft on the link account of USD 200,000.00 so ideally it would need that amount to bring the balance to zero (it's minimum balance). However, as only USD 150,000.00 is allowed that amount is transferred down. The next day the fields will then show:</p>
            <p>CASHFLOW.AMT     100,000.00</p>
            <p>AGREGATE.BAL     -100,000.00</p>
            <p>So now the net amount is zero so no further funds can be taken until there have been more transfers to the higher level account to change the AGREGATE.BAL value. Note the CASHFLOW.AMT is not changed by the system and would remain as USD 100,000.00.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>Must be a valid ID on the AC.SWEEP.TYPE file.</p>
            <p>If GROUP.ID has BACK.VALUE.ADJ as YES in AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM, then   CASHFLOW rule not allowed.</p>

<field>CURRENT.BALANCE</field>
<desc>
            <p>A non input system generated field that shows the balance for this cash pool account. The balance shown depends on the BALANCE.TO.USE field set in the pools corresponding group parameter record.</p>
            <p>If this pool record is seen via the input function then the balance shown will be its current balance.</p>
            <p>If it is viewed via the See function then it will be the balance of the account , the last time the pool record was updated , either online or during the end of day run.</p>
            <p>It is merely a visual aid only.</p>

            <p>Indicates where this pool may be run :</p>
            <p>INTRA  It will be picked up through the online application INTRA.DAY.SWEEP. If not run during the day then it may be picked up during EOD in which case the sweep does not take place but the frequency dates will cycle.</p>
            <p>EOD  If INTRA.DAY.SWEEP is run for this pools corresponding group then this record will not be included in the sweep. This sweep will only occur during end of day.</p>
            <p>If blank then the pool may be processed both on-line and during the end of day processing.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that the override amount is only triggered once the rule conditions have been met. </p>
            <p>For example a SURPLUS rule with a maximum amount set at 100.00 would be run whenever the account is in credit by more than USD100.00. Setting this field to 90.00 would cause the transfer amount to be USD90.00 no matter how large the surplus was. If the account only had a USD50.00 balance the rule, and therefore the override amount, would not be triggered.</p>

<field>MINIMUM.AMT</field>
<desc>
            <p>This amount field (MINIMUM.AMT) is used in conjunction with either a Cashflow, Maintenance or Two Way sweep rule. It controls the minimum amount that needs to be in place on the account. Should the minimum not be there (shortfall) then rule will be triggered and sufficient funds (subject to availability or Limit settings) will be transferred to bring the account up to this amount.</p>
            <p>Use of the OVERRIDE.AMT, OVERRIDE.PERCNT or AMT.ROUTINE may change the amount to be transferred if there is a shortfall.</p>
            <p>Tip: Where a zero amount is required enter as 0.00</p>

            <p>An override percentage can be invoked to calculate the amount to be transferred between the id account and the linked account.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the override percentage is only triggered once the rule conditions have been met. </p>
            <p>For example a SURPLUS rule with a maximum amount set at 100.00 would be run whenever the account is in credit by more than USD100.00. Setting this field to 90% would cause the transfer amount to be 90% of the balance instead. If the account only had a USD50.00 balance the rule, and therefore the percentage amount, would not be triggered.</p>

            <p>An account with a maximum balance of USD 1,000.00 could trigger a sweep of USD 0.01 if the balance of the account was increased to USD 1,000.01. If we specify USD10.00 as MIN.TFR.DR, then sweep will take place only when the sweep amount is more than or equal to USD10.00 (ie when the Balance is more than or equal to USD1010.00).</p>

            <p>Typical input would be low sequence number for the top of the group and higher numbers for those lower in the pyramid. The processing is in descending order, so the rules in the lowest part of the pyramid usually get effected first (as they usually have higher sequence numbers).</p>

<field>AGREGATE.BAL</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is used in conjunction with CASHFLOW type rules. These are essentially the same as a Two Way sweep rule except there is a controlling limit on how much can be taken from higher level account.</p>
            <p>The CASHFLOW.AMT and AGREGATE.BAL fields control how much can be taken from  the higher level account. There is no limit on how much can be transferred to the higher level account.</p>
            <p>Example</p>
            <p>A cashflow limit of USD 100,000.00 is set in field CASHFLOW.AMT. The link account is credited today with USD 50,000.00 and is automatically transferred up to the higher level account. On the next day the fields will show:</p>
            <p>CASHFLOW.AMT     100,000.00</p>
            <p>AGREGATE.BAL        50,000.00</p>
            <p>This means that the amount that can be taken to cover shortfalls is now USD 150,000.00 i.e. the net amount of the two fields. The next transaction causes an overdraft on the link account of USD 200,000.00 so ideally it would need that amount to bring the balance to zero (it's minimum balance). However, as only USD 150,000.00 is allowed that amount is transferred down. The next day the fields will then show:</p>
            <p>CASHFLOW.AMT     100,000.00</p>
            <p>AGREGATE.BAL     -100,000.00</p>
            <p>So now the net amount is zero so no further funds can be taken until there have been more transfers to the higher level account to change the AGREGATE.BAL value. Note the CASHFLOW.AMT is not changed by the system and would remain as USD 100,000.00.</p>
            <p>For take-on purposes the AGREGATE.BAL field can be given a starting value at first input only, once authorised the field is no longer changeable by the user.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>Only valid for CASHFLOW rule types.</p>

<field>AMT.ROUTINE</field>
<desc>
            <p>A user sub-routine which can be invoked to calculate the amount to be transferred between the id account and the linked account.</p>
            <p>A PGM.FILE record will be required before the sub-routine name can be input.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that the sub-routine is only triggered once the rule conditions have been met. </p>
            <p>For example a SURPLUS rule with a maximum amount set at 100.00 would be run whenever the account is in credit by more than USD100.00. Instead of transferring the surplus the sub-routine could provide the amount to transfer based on its own criteria. If the account only had a USD50.00 balance the rule, and therefore the sub-routine, would not be triggered.</p>

            <p>Cash pool link record.Except paremeter 3, all the other parameters are input parameters and are not supposed to be modified by the local routine. Sweep amount is an input/output parameter and the modified value from the local routine will be used by the system as the final sweep amount.</p>

<field>ALLOCATE.SWEEP.AMT</field>

            <p>When there are multiple link accounts, this option allows to treat the Sweeps as a Single sweep or Multiple Sweeps.</p>
            <p>If this option is Checked (Y), the sweep will be treated as a Single Sweep. Only one record will be generated in AC.CASH.POOL.LINK</p>
            <p>If this option is left blank, then it means NO and sweep for each of the link accounts will be treated as a separate sweep. Records will be generated in AC.CASH.POOL.LINK based on the number of link accounts.</p>
            <p>Example : If there are 3 Link accounts and Allocate Sweep is Y, a single record will be generated in AC.CASH.POOL.LINK. The debit/credit from/to the Main Account will be showed as a single entry.In the same case, if Allocate Sweep is N, 3 records will be generated in AC.CASH.POOL.LINK. The debit/credit from/to the Main Account will be shown as 3 different entries.</p>
