<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM defines the basic details of a group. A group is a collection of Accounts that are linked for Cash Pooling purposes. The Accounts need to be of the same Currency but can be owned by different customers.</p>
            <p>The group concept has a main Account and is usually a pyramid type structure where lower level accounts feed funds to/from higher level accounts until the main Account rules are run.</p>

            <p>This field holds the default charge/commission code for the group. Charge is collected for each sweep that falls under the group. Field accepts input of valid record ID of FT.CHARGE.TYPE / FT.COMMISSION.TYPE. This value is defaulted to AC.CASH.POOL record created under the group.</p>

<field>MULTI.RULE</field>

<field>BALANCE.TO.USE</field>
<desc>
            <p>When calculating the amount that needs to be transferred to/from an Account the Cash Pool rules can use one of three possible values as the Account balance.</p>
            <p />
            <p>1. ONLINE CLEARED</p>
            <p>The balance will be based on the Account cleared balance. This balance will not include any uncleared items (for example cheques deposited with a future exposure date).</p>
            <p />
            <p>2. ONLINE ACTUAL</p>
            <p>The balance will be based on the Account uncleared balance. This balance will include uncleared items (for example cheques deposited with a future exposure date).</p>
            <p />
            <p>3. WORKING</p>
            <p>This is the 'worst case' scenario balance as it will be impacted by unauthorised debits and would show a lower balance than the actual balance if there were entries due to be passed to this account. This balance type is more critical for on-line sweeps since during the eod any unauthorised items are placed on hold and the working balance adjusted accordingly.</p>
            <p />
            <p>4.VALUE.DATED</p>
            <p>This balance reflects the current balance after excluding any forward dated FT, Teller or DC entries. If back value dated adjustment is required then the balance to use can be only Value.dated.</p>
            <p />
            <p>5. USER DEFINED</p>
            <p>To arrive Account balance for sweeping purpose based on Bank's requirement instead of any of the above Balance to use option, it can be defined as USER.DEFINED and a valid "S" type of routine from PGM.FILE can be specified in BALANCE.ROUTINE. The balance as arrived by this routine will be used and checked against the Condition as defined in AC.CASH.POOL. To invoke user defined Balances,  the rule should have NULL value in BALANCE.TO.USE for the corresponding record in AC.SWEEP.TYPE.</p>
            <p />
	        <p>6.WORKING LESS LOCKED AMT</p>
	        <p>This option will bring the balance of Working balance less of Locked amount in the account record.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The user must enter one of the ABOVE possible values, there is no default.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>Values allowed are ONLINE CLEARED, ONLINE ACTUAL, VALUE.DATED ,WORKING LESS LOCKED AMT or WORKING or USER DEFINED.</p>
            <p>When using SHARED.BALANCES,BALANCES.TO.USE must be WORKING.</p>

The balance to use in this case can only be WORKING.</p>
            <p>When SHARED.BALANCES is "PARTIAL" balances will be grouped and BALANCE.TO.USE can be other than Working balance.</p>
            <p>Above two cases system creates a record in AC.SHARED.ACCOUNT with ID as Group id and with all accounts involved in the group.</p>
