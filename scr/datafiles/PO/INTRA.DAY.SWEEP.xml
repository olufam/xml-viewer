            <p>This application is used to run the Cash Pooling on-line if the group permits. The user needs to enter the group name (id of AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM) or the sub-group name (also id of AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM).</p>
            <p>All cash pool groups added in AC.CP.GROUP.PARAM except with Balance.to.use as "Value dated" is updated here.</p>
            <p>To trigger sweep process automatically through phantom process, the sweep execution time can be specified here for the relevant group.  By invoking the EB.PHANTOM with Run.Routine as "AC.AUTO.SWEEP.SELECT", all the cash pool records relevant for the Group with execution date as today will be invoked on the specified time.</p>
            <p>When first time Eb.Phantom process is invoked, all the cash pool records with execution time Less than or Equal to the system time will be invoked.</p>

<field>SWEEP.TIME</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specify the time at which this group has to be executed automatically using phantom process.</p>
            <p>All the cash pool records relevant to this Group id with scheduled execution date as  today, will be executed at the time specified here.</p>
            <p>To trigger above process, a record in EB.PHANTOM has to be added with Run.Routine as "AC.AUTO.SWEEP.SELECT" , which can be invoked either as Phantom or Interactive. This routine selects and  triggers the cash pooling process for all the AC.CASH.POOL records which are scheduled for today with scheduled time less than system time. </p>
            <p>Incase the INTRA.DAY is mentioned as SINGLE, then after the cash pool group is executed, the next execution date in AC.CASH.POOL moved as per the frequency given. </p>
            <p>Incase the INTRA.DAY is mentioned as MULTIPLE, then after the cash pool execution, the next execution remains the same. </p>
            <p>Input is in the hh:mm format where:</p>
            <p>hh is the hour (in 24 hour format). Hours of 01 to 09 can also be entered as 1 to 9.</p>

Moreover whenever the phantom process is restarted, all the cash pool with scheduled time less than the system time and  with scheduled execution date as of today is executed once again.</p><p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p /><p>Optional Multi value field</p><p>Duplicate not allowed</p><p>Must be in standard time format.</p></desc>
