            <p>The TELLER.PASSBOOK file allows you to define the format of the data output on a savings account passbook. There is one record allowed in this file, "SYSTEM". </p>
            <p>You can define the data to be output when: </p>
            <p>a)    A new passbook is issued. Eg The customer's name       &amp; address. </p>
            <p>b)    A new page is printed. Eg The balance brought       forward. </p>
            <p>c)    An entry is printed. Ie The transaction amount,       debit/credit column, balance etc. </p>
            <p>d)    The last line of the page is printed. Eg The       balance carried forward. </p>
            <p>e)    The last page of the passbook is printed. Eg New       book issued message. </p>
            <p>The data printed can be any field from the following files: </p>
            <p>      ACCOUNT CUSTOMER COMPANY TRANSACTION CURRENCY       ACCOUNT.STATEMENT STMT.ENTRY CATEGORY       DEPT.ACCT.OFFICER </p>
            <p>Any free format text or one of the following: </p>
            <p>      CREDIT     +ve amount from the entry       DEBIT      -ve amount from the entry       BALANCE    the new account balance       TODAY      todays date       TELLER.ID  the current teller id. </p>
            <p>The remainder of the information in TELLER.PASSBOOK specifies the physical characteristics of the passbook itself. Ie the first physical line to print entries, the size of the spine, the number of pages in the passbook etc. </p>
            <p>Example </p>
            <p>Field                           Column Format Print On </p>

            <p>The "NEW" parameters print the customers name, account number, year of birth etc when a passbook is issued. The line parameter in the column field (column,line) forces the print to take place at the specific physical line rather than printing at the 'current' line. The " " printed at the last detail line forces a new page to be started, ready for the entries to be printed. </p>
            <p>The "FIRST" parameters print the balance carried forward details at the start of each page. The balance and the booking date are taken from the ACCOUNT.STATEMENT record and the last statement entry respectively. Note: The format of the balance field, "11*RX,", means the amount will be printed with leading asterix with the X being replaced by the number of decimal places for the account's currency, ie:  **11,056.78 or ******56.43 </p>
            <p>The "LINE" parameters print the details of each entry. Note: Thecolumn field does not contain a line specification, hence, the data will be output on the current line. If the entry is a deposit then the CREDIT field will contain the amount, otherwise the amount will be held in the DEBIT field. For DEBIT the negative sign is removed before printing using the "N" in the format specification, (11RX,N). </p>
            <p>The output will look like the following: </p>
            <p>   07.02.90 BF                        ***1,551.20 0001    08.02.90 CR                100.00  ***1,651.20 0001    30.06.90 IN                 82.70  ***1,733.90 0002    15.08.90 DR      50.00             ***1,683.90 0006 </p>
            <p>Passbook Lines </p>
            <p>All of the line specifications within the TELLER.PASSBOOK record, SYSTEM, refer to the PHYSICAL lines in the passbook. This is not the same as the entry number or passbook line. In the previous example the last detail line is 35, the first detail line (where to start printing entries) is line 8 with a spine of 3 lines at line 20 to 22. </p>
            <p>It looks like this: </p>
            <p>+------------------------------------------------------ |     Top margin 7 lines | |     Balance carried forward line 1     First entry line .     Entries from line 8 to 19 . 12 | |---- Spine 3 lines ---------------------------------- | 13    Entries from line 23 to 35 . . . . 25 | +----------------------------------------------------- </p>
            <p>The numbers, down the left hand side, refer to the passbook line which will be entered by the teller when he wishes to change the current line to start printing. It is this passbook line which is stored on the ACCOUNT.STATEMENT record. </p>
            <p>In summary, TELLER.PASSBOOK, requires the physical dimensions of the passbook in order to accurately position the print head for printing. The teller will refer only to the passbook line or entry number and the physical line is calculated automatically based on the these dimensions. </p>
