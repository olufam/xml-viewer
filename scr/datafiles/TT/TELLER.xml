<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The TELLER application processes all retail transactions and generates self-balancing entries to the main accounting system.</p>
            <p>    There are two sides to each transaction, the input side (1) and the balancing side (2). Although there are many types of transaction (cash deposit, buy foreign currency etc) they are all processed in the same way. The TELLER.TRANSACTION file determines default account numbers, charges, value dates, advice printing etc.</p>
            <p>    In order to input a transaction the current user must be assigned to an open till number (see TELLER.ID) and it is this number which will determine the internal cash account to be maintained. This number is prompted for on entry of the user's first transaction.</p>
            <p>    Teller can now handle transactions with multiple buy and/or sell transactions within one overall deal. This allows the bank to perform more complex 'Bureau de Change' transactions within a single stream transaction.</p>
            <p>    Automatic calculation of commissions and charges is provided and (for more awkward requirements) the ability to provide the nearest matches above/below currency amounts, for example 'Approx GBP 50 of French Francs' taking into account the actual stock of French banknotes held.</p>
            <p>    When a type of charge or commission is included in a multi-line deal it is applied once for the deal. If the type of charge or commission is dependant on the deal amount then it is calculated once on the total of the amounts in individual lines of the deal with maximum and minimum restrictions applied. More than one charge or commission type may be applied to a deal. When each line is committed the opportunity is presented to specify a single charge amount which replaces all the other charges for a deal.</p>

<field>POSS.DUP.DATE</field>

            <p />
            <p>  For use in connection with the Branch Resilience (BR) product. i.e this field gets enabled only when BR is installed.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  When a breakdown in server communications occurs, at a time when the Teller is finishing a deal, it may not be evident that the deal has completed successfully. Branch Resilience requires the deal to be completed both on the Head Office server and on the backup branch system before it is considered successful. In this event the Teller will re-enter the deal after logging onto the branch backup server, but must flag the deal as a possible duplicate by using this field. The value entered must be the booking date at the branch (this information will be needed when communications are re-established and the deal is also updated at the Head Office). </p>
            <p />
            <p>  With a value in this field set the system will check for other Teller transactions with the same account numbers, value dates and amounts. If one or more is found an override will be raised allowing the user to investigate before committing it or if approved the investigation can be done later.  </p>
            <p />
            <p>  When the deal update is posted on the Head Office server the POSS.DUP.DATE field being present will do the same checking and raise an override - since this is part of an automated process the investigation of the duplicate is done by looking for any deals with POSS.DUP.DATE set and with the warning override present. The system cannot be 100% certain of the deal being a duplicate or whether there are legitimately two exact copy deals, hence user intervention is necessary.</p>

<field>TRANSACTION.NUMBER</field>
<desc>
            <p>This is the reference to the TELLER transaction. It can be in one of two formats; one the standard T24 transaction format means the contract is what may be termed a 'single-leg transaction' where the details of the transaction are on a single TELLER record. Alternatively, there can be transactions which we will refer to as multi-line (meaning there is normally more than one line or leg) and the details of each leg are recorded on a Master record (which shows all the legs and the total charges).</p>
            <p>    The purpose of the multi-line contracts is to allow a client to purchase (or sell) several currencies and be charged commission based on the entire deal rather than several unconnected transactions which could impose the minimum charge for each trade.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>    Single Leg and Master deal references appear as TTyydddnnnnn</p>
            <p>    Multi-line deals appear as TTyydddnnnnn-nn</p>
            <p>    Where yyddd is the Year and day number (Julian date format) and nnnnn/nnnnn-nn are 00001/00001-01 to 99999/99999-99</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>    References can be entered manually or you can allow the system to generate the next one automatically. The COMPANY record must have the TELLER application included in the field PGM.AUTOM.ID and have had the first value set via a valid AUTO.ID.START record. Single legs can than be generated with the 'Next record' icon or F3 function key. Multi-line deals are normally invoked by using a '-' character (without the quotes), with further leg id's being prompted for.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>    It should be noted that the multi-line deals are considered as a 'single entity' by the system. Accounting/charges are still made Real -Time for each leg with Position and PM movements, so T24 is always up to date, but from the Client point of view the transaction is a single deal. If the Version is set for zero authorisation the Teller will see a prompt to 'Finish' the input. If, however, the Version is set for 1 authoriser then if the Teller exits the deal it is not deemed complete, more legs can be added or a separate authorisation process is required.</p>

<field>STMT.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>A number Generated automatically by the system after authorisation which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a transaction. After validation but before authorisation, the value 'VAL' will be inserted in this field to indicate that the transaction has been validated successfully but is still waiting authorisation.</p>
            <p>    After authorisation of a Teller transaction, the system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields. The following examples will illustrate the use of this field.</p>
            <p>    Example 1:</p>
            <p>    On the execution date of a transaction there will normally be an entry on a Customer account and the following type of number will be generated at this field:</p>
            <p>    39.1  STMT.NO ............ 673732684.48           39.2  STMT.NO ............ 1</p>
            <p>    The number automatically generated in field 39.1 is unique to the transaction in question and is built in the following way:</p>
            <p>    1.        The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days           since the 1st of January 1968. In our example, it           corresponds to the 11th of June 1986.</p>
            <p>    2.        The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of seconds           since midnight. In our example, it corresponds to an entry           generated on line at 09:04:44 AM.</p>
            <p>    3.        The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds of           seconds.</p>
            <p>    The value assigned (again automatically) to field 39.2 identifies the number in 39.1 as a statement entry number. If the User wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen the User will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and the type the following at 'Awaiting ID' :-</p>
            <p>    673732684.480001</p>
            <p>    where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first statement entry (there will normally be more than one as the next example will illustrate).</p>
            <p>    Example 2:</p>
            <p>    A second example outlined here is similar to that in example 1, in that there is a statement entry on value date for both the our account and the customer account. The system handles this case as follows:</p>
            <p>    39.1  STMT.NO .......... 673732684.48                 39.2  STMT.NO .......... 1-2</p>
            <p>    Once again field 39.1 contains the identification number automatically generated by the system while field 39.2 now contains two separate numbers signifying that there are infact two separate statement entries, one in respect of the our account pay and one in respect of the our account receive. If the User wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at 'Awaiting ID' type EITHER:</p>
            <p>    673732684.480001</p>
            <p>    where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the statement entry in respect of the our account OR</p>
            <p>    673732684.480002</p>
            <p>    where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the statement entry in respect of the customer account.</p>
            <p>    Example 3:</p>
            <p>    A third example might be that of a category entry generated at initiation of a transaction where commission or charges have been debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss category code. In this case the following entries are generated on the transaction:</p>
            <p>    39.1  STMT.NO .......... 673732684.48                 39.3  STMT.NO .......... 1</p>
            <p>    Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at field 39.1</p>
            <p>    Now, however, field 39.2 is replaced by field 39.3 which now identifies the number in 39.1 as a category entry and not a statement entry.</p>
            <p>    To call this category entry record onto the screen the User must now type:</p>
            <p>    CATEG.ENTRY at 'Awaiting Application'</p>
            <p>    followed by:</p>
            <p>    673732684.480001 at 'Awaiting ID'.</p>

            <p>    Then in this case - the exposure ladder will be multi-valued three times and the EXP. SPT. AMT  field will be updated with 50000, 20000 and 30000.</p>
