            <p />
            <p>The TELLER.ID application is used to open tills, assign users to tills and close and balance tills. </p>
            <p>A user can only perform transactions on a till if the till is open AND he is assigned to that till. A user cannot be assigned to more than one open till at any one time but he can be 'transferred' to another till without performing a close. </p>
            <p>When closing a till the user is requested to enter the current cash amounts which are checked against the system balances. If any discrepancy is discovered an override allows the system to balance automatically by posting to the over/short accounts. </p>
