            <p>This application allows a teller to print passbook entries.  This application is invoked directly after a TELLER transaction or after a TELLER.PASSBOOK.REPRINT instruction.  This application can also be run from the command line.</p>
            <p />
            <p>This application will display the following information to the user:</p>
            <p>1. The Passbook to Insert.</p>
            <p>2. The Page Number to open.</p>
            <p>3. The Line No the print will begin from.</p>
            <p>4. The Number of Entries outstanding that will be printed.</p>
            <p>5. The Current Balance shown in the Passbook.</p>
            <p>6. The number of pages that should be printed.</p>
            <p />
            <p>The Teller can use this application to modify the Page Number, Line Number and instruct a NEW Passbook to be printed.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Once the Teller commits the data the Passbook Print Data will be collected from T24 and sent tot he Teller for printing.  After ALL the pages have been sent this application will display a confirmation message to the Teller asking to confirm if the print was OK.  The Teller can respond YES or NO.  If YES then the Statement Entry files are updated accordingly ready for the next transaction.  If NO then the entries will remain outstanding until they are actually printed.  This application will re-display the initial print page to allow the Teller to re-print the passbook.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If the Passbook can not be printed at this particular time e.g. the customer does not have the passbook or the teller transaction arrived through an alternative channel then the Teller can set the PRINT.PASSBOOK field to NO and the Printing process will not be invoked.</p>
