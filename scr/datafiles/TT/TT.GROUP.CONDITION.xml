            <p>The group of customers who need preferential treatment for Charges, Commission and Exchange rate spread should have been classified under a particular Contract Group for identification. The procedure for defining a Contract Group for Teller related preferential treatment is as given below: In APPL.GEN.CONDITION, create a record with TELLER as Id. CONTRACT.GROUP field of APPL.GEN.CONDITION can be used to create groups like Staff etc. (This is a multi-value field that enables creation of many number of groups based on different decisions) DECIS.FIELD is used to link any field of any application like SECTOR of CUSTOMER to one of the fields in TELLER, so that any transaction made for this contract group will refer to the related TT.GROUP.CONDITION and apply the preferential rates. The linking is done through J descriptors. For example in the Standard Selection record of TELLER, the field CUSTOMER.2 can be linked through J descriptor to the SECTOR field in CUSTOMER. This has to be done under a unique field name. Afterwards in APPL.GEN.CONDITION, under the CONTRACT.GROUP (say Staff), set the DECIS.FIELD to the unique field name and equate it to a sector number relevant for staff (say 9900) </p>

<field>TT.GROUP.CONDITION.ID</field>
<desc>
            <p />
            <p>  Defines the ID of the application. There are two ways of defining the ID:</p>
            <p>  1. The value of a contract group created using APPL.GEN.CONDITION (example: Staff, 10, etc)</p>
            <p>  2. ID like C-100039, where 100039 is the Customer number. If specified like this,  the preferential settings made in TT.GROUP.CONDITION will apply for all the TELLER transaction made for him.</p>

<desc>
            <p />

            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  Where groups of customers are given preferential Commission rates this field is used to define what Percentage of the Standard Commission (as defined in Commission Type table) should be applied. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  Where no Charge/ Commission is to be charged rate must be input as 0%. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  For any percentage rate greater than 0, the Application will compare the calculated amount with the Overall Minimum and Maximum amount defined in the Commission Type table. If the Overall Minimum or Maximum amount is greater or less respectively than the calculated amount, then these overall values will be applied regardless. This is to ensure the Bank always either cover their cost or do not charge excessive amounts. </p>
