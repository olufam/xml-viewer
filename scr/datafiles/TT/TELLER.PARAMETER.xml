<field>SPLIT.CHRG.ENTRIES</field>
<desc>
            <p />
            <p>In Teller Transaction, if charges and taxes are defined, normally, the charge and tax amount will be deducted from the related credit or debit transaction of the customer and accounting entries will be raised for the net amount only.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to split the entries, as one for full transaction amount and the others for the charge, tax related amounts.</p>
            <p>This field is used to split the charges and tax amounts as separate entries, from the credit or debit transaction amount of the account to which the charges and tax are attached.</p>
            <p>If 'YES' is defined in this field, the system will generate separate accounting entries for the charges and taxes attached to the credit or debit transaction, instead of netting them.</p>
            <p>If 'YES' is not defined and left blank, the charge/ tax amount will be adjusted with the respective debit or credit transaction and accounting entry will be raised for the net amount only.</p>
            <p>This feature is not available for transactions done through Multi -line Teller.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>A cash deposit in a customer account of USD10000 has a charge of USD100 and tax of USD10.</p>
