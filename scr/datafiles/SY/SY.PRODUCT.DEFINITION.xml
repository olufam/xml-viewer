            <p>Value type fields are those fields which need not be prorated, when the value for the client deal is derived from the back to back deal. For example, STRIKE.PRICE need not be prorated as the same strike price will be recorded in the client deal and back to back deal. if this field changes in the back to back deal, the same value can be updated in the client deal.</p>
            <p>Ratio type fields are those fields which needs to be prorated when derived from the back to back deal. DAILY.UNITS for example would be a prorated fields. If there are 10 client deals covered by one back to back deal, DAILY.UNITS field will be different in the back to back deal and the client deal.  When the value in the back to back deal changes, the change needs to be prorated on the client deals.ld.</p>
