 This table allows for management of document import into T24 from the T24 Private Wealth Management Client Reporting module.
 
 The Client Reporting module creates records in this table via OFS to catalog .pdf documents within Image Management. This record can then be used to categorise the report documents so that they can be reported upon accordingly via an enquiry.
