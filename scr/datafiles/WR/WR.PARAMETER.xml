<t>
<field>CSV.COL.DELIMITER</field>
<desc>

 The delimiter to use between columns in the CSV output.
 
 Standard CSV tables use a comma (,) as the separator, however this is not recommended, as some data in T24 that will be reported upon (for example descriptive fields) may contain commas.
 
 Therefore, the default separator for T24 Client Reporting is the pipe symbol (|). This is set as default when first amending this record.
 
 If a different separator is required, the T24 Client Reporting module will need to be configured accordingly.
 
 This field can not be changed once set.
