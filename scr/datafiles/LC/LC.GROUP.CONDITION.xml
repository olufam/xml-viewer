<field>RATE.SPREAD</field>

            <p>Specifies the preferential rate used to determine the Customer Spread for a currency exchange as a percentage of the standard Customer Spread.</p>
            <p>Where a customer or group of customers are given preferential exchange rates this field is used to define what percentage of the standard Customer Spread (as defined in the Currency table) should be applied. Where the absolute rate (no Rate Spread) is to be applied the rate specified here must be input as 0%. If the entire spread is to be applied the rate specified here must be input as 100%.</p>
            <p>If left blank the Rate Spread will be the same as for a standard customer (as if 100% was entered).</p>

            <p>This field provides the facility to define whether or not conversion is involved in the transaction in order to determine if different Value Date conditions should be applied. </p>
            <p>ALL means that the condition specified in Customer Float is applicable to all transactions irrespective of the fact that these transactions involve conversion of Currencies. </p>

            <p>Where a customer or group of customers are given preferential commission rates this field is used to define what percentage of the standard commission is applied. Where no commission is to be charged, a rate of 0% should be input. T24 will compare the calculated commission amount with the OVERALL.MIN.AMT and the OVERALL.MAX.AMT defined in the FT.COMMISSION.TYPE record. If the calculated commission amount is outside of this range then the minimum or maximum amounts specified in the commission table will be applied regardless. This is to ensure the bank always covers its costs and doesn't charge excessive commissions.</p>
