<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>Letter of Credit controls the administration and processing of both Letters of Credit and Documentary Collections. It is fully integrated within T24. </p>
            <p>It automates accounting, limit exposure, position updating, control and administration of trading activity and ensures efficient delivery of the related advices, documents, and payments. </p>
            <p>The Letter of Credit types processed by the system can be customised using the LC.TYPES application, where combinations of the major features of an LC can be set up. (e.g. import/export, sight/usance (term), confirmed/unconfirmed, etc.) </p>
            <p>It is important to note that the details set up on the Letter of Credit application do not make any payments or reimbursements.  In order to achieve this, a Drawing must be entered via the DRAWINGS application. This will be linked to the LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract. </p>
            <p>A history of each LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract. and in particular the charges processed for the contract, is held on the LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES application. </p>
            <p>Many events occur within the life of a LETTER.OF.CREDIT contract. Each event is recorded on the contract by (I)nputting to the contract and usually the OPERATION field on the contract will control the event being entered. </p>
            <p />
            <p>The main transactions that the system can process are: </p>
            <p />
            <p>ISSUANCE OF A LETTER OF CREDIT </p>
            <p>Used when the Bank opens a Letter of Credit on behalf of its client (applicant) which will be advised to the beneficiary, via the Bank's correspondent.  Usually in the country that the beneficiary resides. </p>
            <p />
            <p>ADVISING/CONFIRMING A LETTER OF CREDIT </p>
            <p>Used when the Bank receives a Letter of Credit that has been issued by another Bank and is requested to forward it.  (Sometimes via a third party Bank) to the beneficiary with or without adding confirmation. </p>
            <p />
            <p>PRE-ADVISE A LETTER OF CREDIT </p>
            <p>At the request of the applicant, a pre-advice is sent by the issuing Bank, prior to their issuance of the operative credit instrument, to provide the beneficiary, via the advising bank, with brief details of the LC which is in the process of being opened. </p>
            <p />
            <p>AMENDMENT OF A LETTER OF CREDIT </p>
            <p>This facility will allow the user to insert any changes which will produce an amendment to the original terms and conditions of an LC and automatically generate all relevant accounting entries for commissions, increase or decrease of the principal amounts, and advices and documents to the Electronic delivery system. </p>
            <p />
            <p>OPEN A REMITTANCE DOCUMENTARY COLLECTION (EXPORT) </p>
            <p>Used when the Bank (acting as Remitting Bank) receives a Documentary Collection from its client (the drawer) in respect of goods/services they have sold to their customer (the drawee).  The bank forwards the documents to their Correspondent (The Collecting Bank) in the country of residency of the drawer for presentation to the drawee against payment/acceptance. </p>
            <p />
            <p>OPEN A COLLECTING DOCUMENTARY COLLECTION (IMPORT) </p>
            <p>Used when the Bank (acting as Collecting Bank) receives a Documentary Collection from another Bank (The Remitting Bank) for  presentation to the Bank's client (the drawee) against payment/acceptance. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>MAIN FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION -------------------------------- </p>
            <p />
            <p>The main features of the module can be described as follows: </p>
            <p />
            <p>1. INPUT PROCESSING </p>
            <p>Validation is performed to ensure the correctness of any transaction input.  All inputs will update limits, positions, accounts, etc.. in real time.  After authorization of the transaction, all the documents, advices, and SWIFT messages applicable for the L/C will be automatically generated by the Electronic Delivery System. </p>
            <p>All L/C types can be entered in local or foreign currencies, i.e. contracts can be denominated in any currency. </p>
            <p />
            <p>2. CHARGE PROCESSING </p>
            <p>Default charges for all types of Letters of Credit and Documentatary Collections can be entered via the LC.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION application, and will be automatically calculated by the system.  The facility to add extra charges or amend charges is available, together with the facility to waive all charges.  All charge entries are automatically generated, and if specified in a foreign currency, positions will be updated accordingly.  Charges can be amortised over the life of the contract, frequencies defined by the user. </p>
            <p>Charges can be claimed from a number of parties involved in the Letter of Credit or Documentary Collection.  It is important to note that charges can be denominated in a currency other than the Letter of Credit /Documentary Collection Currency. </p>
            <p>Once an LC is authorised, all charges are recorded in the LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES file. Should further charges be input the file will automatically be updated. </p>
            <p />
            <p>3. DOCUMENT PROCESSING </p>
            <p>All documents required to be produced by the input of the transaction will be generated by the Delivery application in order to facilitate easy amendment and customisation of the forms. The T24 Graphical User Interface provides a simple way of entering large volumes of text. </p>
            <p>Frequently used text and clauses can be entered via the LC.ADVICE.TEXT and LC.CLAUSES applications, and then linked into the transaction by entering a short code into the fields provided. </p>
            <p />
            <p>4. ENQUIRIES AND REPORTS </p>
            <p>In common with other T24 Applications, all data can be enquired upon or selectively analyzed and researched.  The system will also automatically produce reports of Collections Due, Unpaid Charges, etc. </p>

            <p>Input in this field is applicable only for <strong>Revolving Letters of Credit.</strong></p>
            <p>This field is used to identify the type of Revolving Letter of Credit applicable.</p>
            <p>Options available are (CM) Cumulative or (NC) Non-Cumulative.</p>
            <p>T24 fully support the internationally recognized understanding of cumulative and non-cumulative revolving letters of credit.</p>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>A revolving letter of credit is issued for $10,000 revolving on the 15th day of every month with 3 revolutions. An initial drawing of $6000 is made and no further drawings were made by the 15th of the month (i.e. the time the first revolution is set to take place).</p>
            <p />
            <p>For a <strong>Cumulative</strong> letter of credit, on         the 15th, the unutilized amount of $4000 will be carried         over by the system to the next revolution period. i.e. the system will provide for the first revolution to be drawn         for an increased amount of $14,000 (being $10,000 +         $4000)</p>
            <p>For a <strong>Non-</strong><strong>Cumulative</strong> letter of credit,         on the 15th, the untilled portion of $4000 is now         unavailable for drawing and the system will provide for         the fist revolution to be drawn for $10000 only..</p>
            <p />
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p />
            <p>Options available are (CM) Cumulative or (NC) Non-Cumulative. </p>
            <p>Default will be null, which indicates that the letter of         credit is not revolving.</p>

            <p>This field is valid for <strong>Documentary Collections and LC.</strong> only. It is used in conjunction with the previous field 'TENOR' to indicate the tenor of the drafts under the collection and is used in the production of corresponding documentary collection messages. </p>
            <p>However, this field in order to support Option K of Tag 32a, accepts "D" or "M" followed by number representing Number of Days or Number of Months.</p>
            <p>Eg. To input a draft of '120 days from the bill of lading date', the number 'D120' would be inserted in this field. The descriptive text i.e. 'days from the bill of lading date' would be inserted in the field 'TENOR'. COLL.MAT.CODE may also be input with BE in this case.</p>
            <p>COLL.MAT.CODE in conjuction with DAYS field will be defaulted for deferred and acceptance LC's in DEFERRED.PAY and DRAFTS.AT fields.</p>

Used as a running total of the remaining credit amount available after all current drawings (if any) have been made under the letter of credit. The amount will be expressed in the currency of the letter of credit (LC.CURRENCY). </p>
            <p>When the letter of credit/documentary collection is input this field will contain either the LC.AMOUNT, or the MAXIMUM.CR.AMT, or the LC amount plus any tolerance indicated in field &lt;PERCENTAGE.CR.AMT&gt;.and any amount entered in the field &lt;ADD.COVERED.AMOUNT&gt;. Whenever drawings are entered, this amount is reduced by the amount of the drawing, so at any stage the total credit amount remaining will be shown by this field. </p>

<field>RISK.PARTY</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field indicates a liability number to be used instead of that of the Issuing Bank's. However, it defaults to the Issuing Bank. This may be entered at any time until DRAWINGS are made under that Letter of Credit.</p>
            <p>Normally, once the <STRONG>Export</STRONG> LETTER.OF.CREDIT is established, the amounts are applied against the limits of the Issuing Bank taking the value from ISSUING.BANK.NO. In cases where the Reimbursing bank is not the Issuing bank, functionally, setting up the limit against the Issuing Bank may not be required but the contract has to reduce the limit of the Reimbursing Bank/Guaranteeing Bank/Confirming Bank. If input at the time of opening the Letter of Credit, then the limits are set against the Reimbursing Bank. But if it is done as an amendment, then the limit usage of the Issuing Bank is reversed and the amount applied against the Reimbursing Bank. This also generates two APP entries for CRF to reverse the old entry and set up the new one.</p>
            <p>The contents of this field are used to indicate the liability and Consolidated Reporting (CRF).</p>
            <p>Replaces the value in the CON.CUS.LINK field, because of which, in an Export Letter of Credit, all the delivery messages, which were hitherto being sent to Issuing Bank, which had defaulted to the CON.CUS.LINK, will now be addressed to the value in this field. Therefore this would warrant a review of mapping of fields in relation to the Delivery messages.</p>

            <p>Operation 'C' provides the operator with the ability to either record a new charge or amend (not cancel or write-off) a previously input charge. Operation 'C' also displays all uncollected charges (having null status) in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES, which are available to the operator to amend. However, keeping the status unchanged at null will enable the system to rewrite the charges back in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES.</p>
            <p>To ensure that no fee/charges are accidentally deleted or 'lost' from the system, once a charge set has been input, it cannot be deleted. However such a charge can be written off in LC.ACCOUNT.BALANCES.</p>

            <p>When using 'T' trace, an MT420 will be produced and the next process date will have to be modified. </p>
            <p>Operation D is used when a decision on a Pending Amendment is to be taken as either Approved or Rejected. Use of this option opens up AMEND.NO and AMEND.STATUS. to use this the Letter of Credit has to be previously authorised in its O status.</p>
