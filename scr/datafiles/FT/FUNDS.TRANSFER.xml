<overview>

            <p>Funds Transfer is a stand-alone module which is fully integrated within the T24 product to provide a total banking service.</p>
            <p>Instructions may be entered either manually or fed direct from other electronic communications systems such as Telex or Swift.  All actual output, whether 'paper' or 'wire', is performed by the T24 - Delivery Module.</p>
            <p>The Funds Transfer Module is a truly on-line, real-time Application designed to handle all types of Local and Foreign Currency, Inward, Outward and Onward payments.</p>
            <p>Also, encompassed within the Funds Transfer Module is a fully operational Standing Order Application.  This Application has user friendly maintenance procedures and provides for fixed and preset payments together with Funds Management initiated by balance levels.  The User may also use the Standing order mechanism to diarise certain non-payment activity.</p>
            <p>Charges, Commissions and Value Dates applicable to any type of transfer are under the control of the User and are automatically performed according to Conditions tables.  These tables may be set up as defaults for each transfer type, be established for individual Customers, or provide general conditions for application to a 'selected' group of customers.</p>
            <p>Available transactions may be immediately input to the System and validated irrespective of the Value Date.  The option exists to provide limited additional information at any time after the initial input, although the transaction may have already been processed.  This will facilitate the situation where a 'Fixing Rate' must be used in certain Funds Transfer transactions, before the 'Fixing Rate' is actually known.</p>
            <p>Any incoming electronic transactions can be handled automatically provided they are formatted to SWIFT standards.  This facility will enable certain transactions to be processed completely without manual intervention.</p>
            <p>The production of all printed matter in respect of payments, from pre-printed Bankers Payments to advices, is controlled within the T24 Delivery System Module.  This System will also cater for all automated communications via Telex, Swift or any other electronic transfer.  The only output direct from Funds Transfer is an Activity Journal and an Exception Report.</p>
            <p>1.         PRODUCTS PROCESSED BY THE SYSTEM</p>
            <p>The main product types handled by this Module can be classified as follows:</p>
            <p>1.1        Outward Payments            (incorporating Onward payments)</p>
            <p>These may be input manually or be generated automatically from            standing orders or incoming formatted messages.</p>
            <p>The types of Outward Payments that can be processed are:</p>
            <p>-    Account Transfers            -    Manager cheque (drawn on ourselves)            -    Bank draft            -    Bankers Payment            -    Electronic Transfers via Telex, Swift            -    Local Clearing Payments            -    Direct Drawings</p>
            <p>Currently, outward payments are only generated for SIC, if            required for other systems these must be added as a local            enhancement.</p>
            <p />
            <p>1.2        Inward Payments</p>
            <p>Inward Payments for the credit to an Account in the bank are            generated manually or automatically from incoming formatted            telexes.</p>
            <p>The types of Inward Payments are:</p>
            <p>-    Telex, Swift            -    Cheques/Drafts            -    Bankers Payment            -    Mail            -    Local Clearing (currently only SIC)</p>
            <p />
            <p>1.3        Batch Payments</p>
            <p>A future enhancement is planned to enable Customers to send-in            magnetic tapes containing numerous payments (e.g. salary            payments) for automatic generation of the payments through the            Funds Transfer System.</p>
            <p />
            <p>1.4        Standing Orders</p>
            <p>The Standing Orders Application is an integral part of the            Funds Transfer Application and interfaces directly with the            Funds Transfer main program for the generation of all derived            payments.</p>
            <p>The types of Standing Order that can be loaded are:</p>
            <p>-    Fixed Payments, with known amount and frequency            -    Preset Payments when amount not known            -    Balance Maintenance with automatic transfer of excess                 funds            -    Balance Maintenance with automatic transfer of funds into                 the account to maintain a minimum balance.            -    Diary Instructions - including non-financial information            -    Direct Debit Authorities held.</p>

<field>LOC.AMT.CREDITED</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the local Currency equivalent of the AMOUNT.CREDITED.</p>
            <p>There are two methods to calculate the local Currency equivalent : STANDARD and MIDDLE. Which method is used depend on the field MKT.EXCH.METHOD in the FT.APPL.DEFAULT file.</p>
            <p />
            <p>1. MKT.EXCH.METHOD is STANDARD:</p>
            <p>When the Funds Transfer transaction involves 2 foreign currencies (i.e. neither the debit currency nor the credit currency is equal to the local currency) and the currency of the AMOUNT. CREDITED is the BASE.CURRENCY then the Middle Rate is used for the conversion, otherwise the TREASURY.RATE is used. When, on the contrary, either the debit currency or the credit currency is equal to local currency and the currency of the AMOUNT.CREDITED is the local Currency then the LOC.AMT.CREDITED is the same amount.</p>
            <p>The AMOUNT.CREDITED may include the TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT if credit less charges is used.  In this case only the transfer amount will be converted as above, and the LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT will be then be subtracted from the result to give the LOC.AMT.CREDITED.</p>
            <p>The following example (including 2 foreign currencies) will clarify the conversion of foreign currency amounts into their local currency equivalent:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose an outgoing transfer by telex where the customer asks to transfer the equivalent of CHF2000 in French francs with the following exchange rates:</p>
            <p>-    Cross Rate Treasury=4,0943            -    Cross Rate Customer=4,0533            -    Mid Rate GBP/CHF=2,44            -    Treasury Rate GBP/FRF=9,99</p>
            <p>Field Name         Value</p>
            <p>DEBIT.CURRENCY     CHF DEBIT.AMOUNT       2,000.00 CREDIT.CURRENCY    FRF CHARGES.ACCT.NO    3336  CUR/ACC CHF AMOUNT.DEBITED     CHF 2,000.00 AMOUNT.CREDITED    FRF 8,106.56 TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT   CHF    72.06 TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT   CHF     7.66 LOC.AMT.DEBITED    (GBP) 819.67 LOC.AMT.CREDITED   (GBP) 811.47 LOC.TOT.TAX.AMT    (GBP)   3.14 LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 LOC.POS.CHGS.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT           8.20</p>
            <p>It can be seen that:</p>
            <p>1) The AMOUNT.DEBITED (BASE.CURRENCY) has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>2) The AMOUNT.CREDITED (non base currency) has been converted at the treasury rate of 9,99.</p>
            <p>3) The TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>4) The TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>5) The MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT, when charges and commissions are booked in a separate entry, is derived from the difference between the           LOC.AMT.DEBITED and the LOC.AMT.CREDITED.</p>
            <p>2. MKT.EXCH.METHOD is MIDDLE :</p>
            <p>Middle rate is always used for the conversion.</p>

            <p>If no input is made in this field the Application will default to the appropriate Currency and Charge Amount (as explained within Charge Type). Input to this field will only be allowed when the associated Charge Type has been input and will override the applicable default value.</p>
            <p>After the validation process, all the amounts will be displayed in the Currency of the Account bearing the charges, and any changes must specify the same Currency code as that already displayed. Any original input in a different Currency will no longer be displayed in that Currency.</p>
            <p>The Application will also check when the Charge code has been defined with the value Credit less charge that the total Charge amount does not exceed the amount to be transferred (or to be credited in our books) otherwise, it will be refused.</p>
            <p>In addition if the residual amount is less than the minimum transfer limit defined in the Application default file, an override will be requested.</p>

When an input is made in this field, the Application will only accept Currency codes which comply with: - The Currency of the Account bearing the Charges; or - The Currency of the Transfer Amount, i.e. credit Currency for outgoing payments and debit Currency for incoming payments; or - Local Currency. The Currency must be the same for all Charge and Commission Types. The Numeric Currency Code must be an existing code on the NUMERIC.CURRENCY table.</p>

<field>CHARGES.ACCT.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the Account Number where the commissions and charges are to be debited when the Customer specifies that they are to be applied to a separate account.</p>
            <p>When no input has been made in this field and the transaction is subject to commissions or charges to be borne by the Customer, the Funds Transfer Application will select the default charges for the Account as explained below:</p>
            <p>If a specific account number has been defined for commission and charges on the CUSTOMER.CHARGE record of the principal customer, this account will then be defaulted in this field.</p>
            <p>If a separate entry for the commission/charges is defined in the relevant Group Condition, a separate charge /commission entry will be generated for this transaction in the Debit Account Number for outgoing payments and in the Credit Account Number for incoming payments.</p>
            <p>If neither of these two conditions is applicable, the Application will book the charges/commissions together with the transfer Amount.  For Outgoing payments, the Customer will be debited for the transfer amount plus the amount of charges/commissions in the Account specified in the Debit Account No. field.  For Incoming payments the Customer will be credited for the transfer amount less the amount of charges and commission in the Account specified in the Credit Account No. field.</p>
            <p>If the Account number input in this field is an internal type of account, then the system will ensure that it equates to the Claim Charge Account specified in the Funds Transfer Application Default table.  In this situation, a separate Claim Charge Advice will be printed to claim the amount from the Ordering Bank.  The same default values (Debit plus charges for outgoing transfers and Credit less charges for incoming transfers) will be used by the system if the claim charge account is input in this field.</p>
            <p>When the Commission/Charge Code indicates Debit plus charges, the Application will always default to the Debit account number in this field except when the Debit Account number is a Nostro.  When the Debit account number is a Nostro, the Application will default to the Claim Charge Account as defined in the Funds Transfer Application default table.  In all the cases a separate entry will be raised to allow ease of reconciliation for the sending bank.</p>

<field>LOC.AMT.DEBITED</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the local Currency equivalent of the AMOUNT.DEBITED.</p>
            <p>There are two methods to calculate the local Currency equivalent : STANDARD and MIDDLE. Which method is used depend on the field MKT.EXCH.METHOD in the FT.APPL.DEFAULT file.</p>
            <p>1. MKT.EXCH.METHOD is STANDARD:</p>
            <p>When the Funds Transfer transaction involves 2 foreign currencies (i.e. neither the debit currency nor the credit currency is equal to the local currency) and the currency of the AMOUNT. DEBITED is the BASE.CURRENCY then the Middle Rate is used for the conversion, otherwise the TREASURY.RATE is used. When, on the contrary, either the debit currency or the credit currency is equal to local currency and the currency of the AMOUNT.DEBITED is the local Currency then the LOC.AMT.DEBITED is the same amount.</p>
            <p>The AMOUNT.DEBITED may include the TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT if debit plus charges is used. In this case only the transfer amount will be converted as above, and the LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT will be then be added to the result to give the LOC.AMT.DEBITED.</p>
            <p>The following example (including 2 foreign currencies) will clarify the conversion of foreign currency amounts into their local currency equivalent:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose an outgoing transfer by telex where the customer asks to transfer the equivalent of CHF2000 in French francs with the following exchange rates:</p>
            <p>-    Cross Rate Treasury=4,0943            -    Cross Rate Customer=4,0533            -    Mid Rate GBP/CHF=2,44            -    Treasury Rate GBP/FRF=9,99</p>
            <p>Field Name         Value</p>
            <p>DEBIT.CURRENCY     CHF DEBIT.AMOUNT       2,000.00 CREDIT.CURRENCY    FRF CHARGES.ACCT.NO    3336  CUR/ACC CHF AMOUNT.DEBITED     CHF 2,000.00 AMOUNT.CREDITED    FRF 8,106.56 TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT   CHF    72.06 TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT   CHF     7.66 LOC.AMT.DEBITED    (GBP) 819.67 LOC.AMT.CREDITED   (GBP) 811.47 LOC.TOT.TAX.AMT    (GBP)   3.14 LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 LOC.POS.CHGS.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT           8.20</p>
            <p>It can be seen that:</p>
            <p>1) The AMOUNT.DEBITED (BASE.CURRENCY) has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>2) The AMOUNT.CREDITED (non base currency) has been converted at the treasury rate of 9,99.</p>
            <p>3) The TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>4) The TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>5) The MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT, when charges and commissions are booked in a separate entry, is derived from the difference between the           LOC.AMT.DEBITED and the LOC.AMT.CREDITED.</p>
            <p>2. MKT.EXCH.METHOD is MIDDLE:</p>
            <p>Middle rate is always used for the conversion.</p>

<field>OVERRIDE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Contains all the Override messages which the User agreed to during Input.</p>
            <p>During the validation stage of a Funds Transfer transaction the system may provide the User with a series of screen override messages, to indicate an anomaly, for instance, that the exchange rate varies by more than the variation tolerance defined in the currency table.</p>
            <p>In the event that the User confirms the Override, the full text of the actual Override Message will be stored, for reference purposes only, in this multi-value field.</p>
            <p>For example, if the User inserts an 'abnormal' exchange rate in the field corresponding to the exchange rate then when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:</p>
            <p>'VARIANCE OF RATE EXCEEDS PERMITTED TOLERANCE'</p>
            <p>This will draw the User's attention to the rate entered, which may be a mistake and can then be corrected, or, on the other hand, it may be correct input and so the User confirms that this rate is really intended.</p>
            <p>A second example might be in respect of a Funds Transfer transaction done with a client who does not have a credit line established with the bank and where the amount of the outgoing transfer exceeds the balance of the account. In this case when the transaction is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads:</p>
            <p>'ACCOUNT NNN UNAUTHORISED OVERDRAFT'</p>
            <p>Once again the User's attention is drawn to the situation and either corrected or confirmed via a positive response to the Override Message.</p>
            <p>If, subsequently, the Funds Transfer record is either fully displayed or printed, then all override messages will be present.</p>

            <p>To send Envelope Contents details, MT103.type can be  given as MT103Extend and Extend format &amp; info can be given in next fields which will generate MT103 with Tag 77T.</p>
            <p>MT103+ can be generated to make it straight through processable with bank field tags as "xxA".</p>
            <p>If field MT103.CONTROL in  FT.APPL.DEFAULT is "System", then the bank fields ( for Tag  52, 54, 55, 56 and 57)  in FT must have either a valid BIC code ("SW-") or  Customer number who has valid record in DE.ADDRESS with carrier as "SWIFT.1" otherwise then system will raise an Error. Moreover Ben.Acct.No is also mandatory.</p>
            <p>In case MT103.CONTROL is Null and above condition is not met, system automatically generates MT103 instead of MT103+ with an override.</p>
            <p>For MT103+, field 119 of the User Header of the message MT103 will be having Validation flag as STP. For MT103Extend, field 119 Validation flag will be REMIT.</p>

<field>REC.CORR.BANK</field>

            <p>Identifies the Correspondent Bank for the Receiver Bank (i.e. the bank servicing the Account held by the Receiver Bank in the Currency of the Credit Amount).</p>
            <p>The Receiver Correspondent Bank is the location where the funds will be made available for the Receiver.</p>
            <p>The presence of the Receiver Bank, together with this field, indicates that two payment messages should be generated:</p>
            <p>- Payment Order or Draft Payment to the Receiver Bank</p>
            <p>- Cover Cable to Our Correspondent Bank Nostro</p>
            <p>If this field is not entered it will default automatically from the data stored in the Receiver Bank's Agency record.</p>
            <p>This field corresponds to field 54 in SWIFT messages when Cover Method is COVER.DIRECT, COVER.NEAR.</p>
            <p>When Cover Method is THIRD-INST then this field corresponds to tag 55(Third Reimbursement Institution) in MT103 message and in Tag 57 in MT202 (Cover-Payment).</p>
            <p>Extreme care should be taken when the name and address of the Receiver Correspondent Bank is entered manually, by means of the four available lines, as any direct input will be accepted without further validation.</p>
            <p>The Funds Transfer Application will only issue a cover payment for Outward payments:</p>
            <p>- by Telex (Transaction Type OT) or - by Draft (Transaction type OD)</p>
            <p>As a general rule, within the Funds Transfer Application, a Cover Payment will be issued when no account relationship (e.g. Nostro account, Vostro account) exists between the Sender and the Receiver of the payment instructions.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>Let us suppose that British Bank, London send a direct Telex payment order to Belgium Bank in Brussels (with whom they have test arrangements) requesting them to pay Deutsche Marks 1,000,000.00 to one of their Customers.</p>
            <p>Because British Bank London does not maintain its Nostro Account in Deutsche Marks with Belgium Bank, Brussels but with German Bank, Frankfurt and Belgium Bank, Brussels does not maintain their Nostro Account in Deutsche Marks with British Bank, London but with another German Bank in Frankfurt, the Funds Transfer Application will automatically create a Cover payment which will be sent to British Bank's correspondent in Germany.</p>
            <p>Cable to: German Bank, Frankfurt requesting them to pay Deutsche Mark 1,000,000.00 to the other German Bank favour Belgium Bank Brussels with the message 'In cover of our direct Telex payment order to you.'</p>
            <p>The cost of a Cover Cable, in respect of either a Draft or Telex, may be automatically recovered by use of the Secondary Telex Charge field within the Application Default File.</p>

<field>NEG.DEALER.REFNO</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Negotiated Dealer Reference Number of the foreign exchange internal deal which has been created specifically to cover the exchange rate for this F.T.</p>
            <p>The Currency table defines the negotiable amount, i.e. the amount above which the exchange rate to be used should be agreed with the dealer. Funds Transfer transactions, where the amount exceeds this Negotiable Amount, require the specific rate to be input and the associated internal deal reference number may then be entered.</p>
            <p>The Negotiable Dealer Reference, if input, must be a unique reference number which is assigned from F.X.. Entry of this reference will cause the FX deal to be identified, matched, and cancelled automatically when the Funds Transfer transaction is finally accepted by the Application. Thus avoiding a double update of the foreign Currency position. Any internal deal, which is yet to be matched by a corresponding F.T. transaction, can be viewed in the Exception display of the Foreign Exchange Application.</p>
            <p>Internal deals are created within FX to allow dealers the option of immediate updates of the Currency positions, without dependence on other departments.</p>
            <p>Validation ensures that the deal with this reference, already exists before this input will be accepted.</p>
            <p>The User should input only the sequence number of the FX transaction to relate to a deal which has been input, or other unique known reference. The System will then automatically access the Negotiated Deal Reference file to retrieve the related transaction.</p>
            <p>Note : It must be remembered that when the transaction amount is greater than the negotiable amount, only the customer spread (as defined on the CURRENCY table) will be added to the Treasury rate.</p>

<field>CREDIT.VALUE.DATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the date when the Credit entry is to be given value for interest purposes.</p>
            <p>For Internal Accounts the default Credit Value Date is the Processing Date. For other Accounts the rules can be summarised as follows: 1. For each Transaction Type, Default Value Date conditions are defined in the Transaction Type Condition table. The User will first define in this table the Default Value Date for the transfer , i.e. the Default Value Date which will apply for the Bank (Debit Value Date for inward transfer and the Credit Value Date for the outward transfer). The Value Date conditions applicable to the Customer entry (Debit Value Date for outward transfers and the Credit Value Date for the inward transfers) are then defined by specifying a number of days to be added (Inward Payments) or subtracted (Outward Payments) from the Bank Value Date.</p>
            <p>2. The User can also define different default Value Date conditions for groups of Customers in the Group Condition table. This table will be referenced by the User when applying special conditions to particular groups of Customers (such as Banks, Staff, Prime Customers).</p>
            <p>3. Finally, default Value Date conditions can also be defined at the Customer level by means of the Customer Condition table. The User will refer to this table when any particular Customer is to receive special conditions.</p>
            <p>When the Value Date is not input, the Funds Transfer Application will verify if the Customer has special Value Date conditions or whether it is part of a group of Customers which have been afforded special conditions, and if not, it will apply the Transaction Type default Value Date conditions.</p>
            <p>For the default Value Dates, the Application will first generate the Value Date applicable to the Bank (Debit Value Date of inward transfers and Credit Value Date for outward transfers) and then calculate the Customer Value Date (credit or debit) according to the number of days float defined in the appropriate tables.</p>
            <p>Credit value dates on incoming funds transfers can also be calculated by setting the CUT.OFF.TIME field on the CURRENCY file. For this method to be applied CUT.OFF.TIME must be set to a valid time, if this is the case and no credit value date is entered, the calculated date will be applied, if a credit value date has been entered and it is before the calculated date then an override will be requested.</p>
            <p>Note : For Outward Payments, if there is no record in the Holiday table for the Country of the credit currency, the Value Date will be checked against the Local Holiday table record. If the Local Holiday table record is also missing, the transfer will be rejected.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p />
            <p>Up to 9 Date characters (Standard Date format in range 1950-2049) - type D. (Optional input. For default values see Details.) </p>
            <p>The date entered must not exceed the maximum system forward Value Date defined in the Dates file.</p>
            <p>The date entered must not exceed the maximum system back Value Date defined in the Dates file.</p>
            <p>If  the date exceeds the maximum forward value date defined in the Transaction Type condition table, an override will be requested.</p>
            <p>If the date exceeds the maximum back Value Date defined in the Transaction Type condition table, an override will be requested.</p>
            <p>The Debit Value Date cannot be greater than the Credit Value Date except for AC type transactions that have the DB.AFTER.CR field set to Yes.</p>
            <p>An override will be requested when this date is prior to the Processing date.</p>
            <p>For Outward Payments, an override will be required when the date is not a working day in the country of the credit Currency. For all other   Transaction Types, an override will be requested if the date input is not a local working day. </p>
            <p>For the Transaction Types OC (outward by cheque), and OB (outward by bankers payment) the Value Date must be equal to the processing date. </p>
            <p>For outward transaction types, if the Transaction Type condition table specifies 'NO' default value date, input in this field mandatory. </p>
            <p>If CUT.OFF.TIME (CURRENCY file) has been set then the default credit value date for an incoming funds transfer will be calculated as shown in the following table</p>

<field>TRANSACTION.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Transaction Type applicable to the transaction being processed.</p>
            <p>There are two basic types, Outward and Inward. (Outward includes Onwards.)</p>
            <p>The following Transaction Types are processed by the Funds Transfer Application:</p>
            <p />
            <p>1.   Outward Payment Instructions</p>
            <p>These are transactions where the beneficiary of the payment does not maintain an appropriate account relationship and where usually the Bank will credit a Nostro account (foreign currency payment) or a Clearing/ Vostro account (local currency payment) to execute the payment.</p>
            <p>Within T24 the Outward Payment orders are classified as follows:</p>
            <p>OC   Outward by cheque.  Refers to the issuing by the bank of a Manager cheque or Bank cheque in local Currency in favour of             the beneficiary who does not maintain an account with the             bank.</p>
            <p>OD   Outward by draft.  Refers to the issuing by the bank of a Bank Draft (usually in foreign Currency) in favour of the             beneficiary who does not maintain an account with the bank.</p>
            <p>OT   Outward by telex.  Refers to the issuing by the bank of a payment via SWIFT or TELEX.  The instructions are usually sent             to the Banks correspondent.  Use of this Transaction Type will             produce both pay and cover cables automatically where             required.</p>
            <p>OB   Outward by Bankers Payment.  Refers to the issuing by the bank of a Bankers Payment in local Currency.  This method of             payment is used extensively in the U.K. to perform local             Currency interbank payments between banks only.</p>
            <p>BC   Outward by local clearing system.  This transaction type can be customised according to local rules by using the             FT.BC.PARAMETER application.  The only clearing system which             will currently produce payments is the Swiss clearing system,             SIC.</p>
            <p />
            <p>2.   Inward Payment Instructions</p>
            <p>These are transactions where the beneficiary of the payment is one of our Customers who requires the funds to be credited to an account in our books.  The Inward Payment are classified as follows:</p>
            <p>IC   Inward Payment by cheque or draft.  Refers to the receipt by the bank of a cheque or a draft to be credited to a Customer             account in our books.</p>
            <p>IT   Inward by telex.  Refers to the receipt by the bank of a SWIFT or TELEX payment in favour of one of our Customers and where             the proceeds have to be credited to an account in our books.</p>
            <p>IM   Inward by mail transfer.  Refers to the receipt by the bank of a mail transfer payment in favour of one of our Customers and             where the proceeds have to be credited in an account in our             books.</p>
            <p>IB   Inward by Bankers Payment.  Refers to the receipt by the bank of a Bankers payment in favour of an account in our books (in             U.K. only).</p>
            <p>BI   Inward via Local clearing system.  Refers to the receipt by the bank of a local clearing payment in favour of an account             in our books.  These payments are usually generated             automatically via tape or an external link, and can only be             used if defined on FT.LOCAL.CLEARING.</p>
            <p />
            <p>2.1  Inward Direct Debit Instructions</p>
            <p>These are local clearing transactions where a customer has an agreement to allow his account to be debited automatically by a specified beneficiary. Direct debit instructions are usually processed automatically from an external source, such as a tape.</p>
            <p>BD   Inward local clearing direct debit payment. Refers to the receipt by the bank of a direct debit instruction from an             account in our books.  These payments can only be used if             defined on FT.LOCAL.CLEARING.</p>
            <p />
            <p>3.   Internal Payment Instructions.</p>
            <p>Two additional Transaction Types are covered within the Funds Transfer Application:</p>
            <p>AC   Account Transfer.  Refers to an Inhouse transfer of funds, i.e. a transfer of funds between two Customer accounts or two             internal accounts in our books.</p>
            <p>DW   Direct Drawing.  This refers to transfers from one account to another by correspondent banks who maintain accounts within             our books.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>2 type AAA (alpha A-Z, a-z) character Transaction Type code.  (Mandatory input.)</p>

<field>CHARGE.CODE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies how the Charges are to be applied, i.e. which party is to pay for the charges.</p>
            <p>C = Credit less Charges The Credit less Charges value will indicate that, for outgoing payments, the amount of charge will be deducted from the Transfer Amount which is remitted to the receiver bank. For Incoming payments, the amount of charge will be deducted from the received amount (Transfer amount) and credited to a Profit and Loss Category code. If the Customer has requested the bank to apply all commissions and charges to a separate account, the complete Transfer Amount will be credited to one account and the corresponding commissions and charges debited to the specific charge/commission account of the Customer.</p>
            <p>D = Debit plus Charge The Debit plus Charge value will indicate, for outgoing payments, that the complete transfer amount will be remitted to the receiver bank and the charges amount will be collected from our ordering Customer. For incoming payments, the complete transfer amount will be credited to our beneficiary Customer and the charge amount will be debited to the Default Claim Charge Account or specified in the Charges Account Number.</p>
            <p>W = Waive Charge The Waive Charge value will indicate that no charge is to be applied on this transaction. Any input in the fields Charge Type and Charge Amount will consequently be refused.</p>
            <p>Example of Credit Less Charges: One of our Customers requests the bank to pay USD 10,000.00 less the charges and that our charge amount is USD 10.00.</p>
            <p>We will debit our Customer for USD 10,000.00, credit the appropriate Nostro account for 9,990.00 USD (which will be the Transfer amount) and credit our charge Profit and Loss category code for USD 10,00 (or equivalent in local Currency if different from USD).</p>
            <p>Note : For balance maintenance Standing Orders and any transfers with Nostros for both Debit and Credit accounts, the default value generated is W (Waive Charges).</p>

            <p>C, D, or W - see Details. (Optional input. Default values are: D for outgoing payments or C for incoming payments, W for any transfer with Nostro accounts for both both Debit and Credit). For Outward Payments where the Debit Account is either a Profit and Loss Category Code or an internal Account, both the Commission Code and Charge Code must equate to Waive, unless the Charges Acct No is specified. For Inward Payments, where the Credit Account is either a Profit and Loss Category Code or an internal Account, both the Commission Code and Charge Code must equate to Waive. If a Charge Code of Credit is specified in this field, the value of the Commission code can only be Credit or Waive. If a Charge Code of Debit is specified in this field, the value of the Commission Code can only be Debit or Waive.</p>
            <p>If BEN.OUR.CHARGES = BEN and the system has been set to produce swift MESSAGE MT103 Single Customer Credit Transfer via the transaction type and FT.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION then this field must be C- Credit less charges and a valid commission code must be entered.

            <p>Any transaction with a future Processing Date will appear in the books of the bank as forwards, until a batch program is run to process it.  Such a transaction can be input or Authorised as normal and will be identified with specific Funds Transfer status codes of IFWD or AFWD.</p>
            <p>By means of the Exception display of the Funds Transfer Application the User can monitor and control the status of such transactions until the batch program has been run.  Ideally, the Processing Date batch program should be run as an initial activity, each morning, to apply the transactions which are now to be processed on that day.</p>

<field>COMMISSION.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Commission Types which are applicable to the transaction being processed. If no input is made in these fields, the Application will default the Commission Types.</p>
            <p>The rules relating to the handling of the default Commission Types by the Funds Transfer Application can be summarised as follows:</p>
            <p>1. For each Transaction Type, default Commission Type conditions may be defined in the Transaction Type table. The User may define in this table all Commission Types applicable to each Transaction Type.</p>
            <p>2. The User can also define different Commission Type conditions for groups of Customers in the Group Condition table. This table will be enhanced by the User when special conditions are to be applied to particular groups of Customers (e.g. Banks, staff, Prime Customers, etc.).</p>
            <p>3. Finally, default Commission Type conditions can also be defined at the individual Customer level by means of the Customer Condition table. The User will create entries in this table when a particular Customer is to receive special conditions.</p>
            <p>When no Commission Types are input, the Funds Transfer Application will verify if the Customer has special Commission Type conditions or whether the Customer is part of a group of Customers which have been afforded special conditions. Otherwise it will apply the Transaction Type default Commission Type conditions. Any direct input by the User will, however, override the applicable default conditions and will become the only Commission Type data to be applied to the transaction. In such a situation the Commission Type code will be used only as enrichment when a Commission Amount has been entered in the next field or, if left blank, the amount will be calculated from the values held in the Commission Type entry.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>2 character Commission Type code (alphanumeric) - Type A. Associated multivalue field. (Optional input. See Details for default) The code must exist in the Commission Type table. When this field is input, the input of an amount will be allowed. If the type is entered with no amount then the values from the Code in the Commission file are used in the associated Commission Amount field. If no data is entered the User can view all the standard default Commission Types and associated amounts generated by the Application by specifying Yes in the Charge.Commission.Display field.</p>
            <p>If BEN.OUR.CHARGES = BEN and the system has been set to produce swift MESSAGE MT103 Single Customer Credit Transfer via the transaction type and FT.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION  then this field is mandatory.</p>

For Outward Payment Orders, this account field will usually contain the Account in our books which is specified by the Customer requesting the payment.</p>
            <p>To differentiate between an Account Number and a Category code, the Funds Transfer Application will require the letters PL to be appended to the front of any Category code.  Any other input without these letters will be considered to be an Account Number.</p>

<field>BASE.CURRENCY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Currency that is used as the base when an exchange rate is being quoted on an FT transaction that involves two different currencies.</p>
            <p>When the Base Currency is not entered during input and the transaction involves local currency, the system will default to the local currency provided the quotation code on the currency record of the other currency is NULL.  If the quotation code of the other currency is not equal to null, then that currency will become the Base Currency.</p>
            <p>The proper identification of the base currency will allow the Exchange Rate routine to validate the Exchange Rate input by the user against the tolerance values contained in the Currency table.</p>
            <p>When the base currency is not specified and the transaction involves two currencies where none is the currency, it will default to the currency which yields a cross-rate greater than unity (One).</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example 1:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that a UK User is processing a Funds Transfer transaction involving Pounds Sterling and American Dollars.  The base currency, which will be defaulted in this case, will be Pounds Sterling because the quotation code of the U.S. Dollar will be equal to null in the currency table. i.e. in United Kingdom it is the Pound Sterling (local currency) which is that currency, against which all foreign currencies are quoted.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example 2:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that a UK User is processing a Funds Transfer transaction involving French Francs and Deutsche Marks.  The base currency which will be defaulted in this case will be the Deutsche Marks because it is the currency which yields a cross-rate greater than unity.  If a rate of 0.33 has been input, the user will be informed that the rate is out of range unless he indicates that French Francs is the Base Currency.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example 3:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that a User in France is processing a Funds Transfer transaction involving US Dollars and French Francs.  The base currency will then be the US Dollar as the quotation code will be set, in the currency record, then US Dollars would be the Base Currency.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>3 character Currency code (uppercase alpha or numeric) - Type SSS.  (Optional input.  If entered, then used in rate validation. Otherwise default value will be automatically derived from currency tables.)</p>

<field>RATE.FIXING</field>
<desc>
            <p>To invoke Currency Fixing rates functionality this field can be used.</p>
            <p>Value is defaulted from RATE.FIXING field in FT.APPL.DEFAULT. Defaulted values can be modified in FT from Yes to No but not Vice versa.</p>
            <p>In CURRENCY application, when FIXING.DATE is less than the FT Processing date, then Funds transfer will be created based on the value in this field, which is explained below:-</p>
            <p>Case 1: When Rate.Fixing is "No" and for override "RATE NOT FIXED, USE EXISTING RATE" response is given as "YES" then  system processes the Funds transfer contract using the existing exchange rate and all accounting entries and delivery messages get generated.. If "No" is given for the above override then FT record created with status as ANORATE and when FT.RATES run online,  for FT's which are in ANORATE status- accounting entries ,Position updates &amp; Delivery messages are generated using exchange rate available at that time. (Existing Functionality)</p>
            <p>Case 2: If Rate.Fixing field is set as "Yes" and the Fixing.date in Currency Application is less than FT processing date and  then funds transfer will be created with "ANORATE/INORATE" status (Based on FT record status) using the dealer desk as given in FT.APPL.DEFAULT. Once the Exchange rate is fixed for the day, then FT.RATES can be run online to create accounting entries and delivery messages which will use latest exchange rate and create entries with the dealer desk as given in FT. Also position entry which got created earlier using Dealer desk as given in FT.APPL.DEFAULT, gets reversed.</p>
            <p>Case 3: If this flag is set as "Yes" and the Fixing.date in Currency application equal to processing date then funds transfer will be created with processing date as Next working date  with status as AFWD/IFWD (Based on FT record status)- No accounting entries, Position or delivery message gets generated. During next day EOD processing these AFWD contracts are processed as per Case 2.</p>
            <p>Above processing is same for FT's which is created through STO application.</p>
            <p>When this field is set as "YES" then FT's inputted via OFS will be processed as per CASE 2. Otherwise FT will be created using existing rates.</p>
            <p>See FIXING.DATE in Currency application to know more about fixing rates functionality.</p>

<field>DEBIT.VALUE.DATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Date when the Debit entry is to be given value for interest purposes.</p>
            <p>For Internal Accounts, the default Debit Value Date is the Processing Date. For other Accounts the rules are as follows:</p>
            <p>1. For each Transaction Type, default Value Date Conditions are defined in the FT.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION table. The User will first define in this table the default Value Date for the transfer itself, i.e. the default Value Date which will apply for the Bank (Debit Value Date for inward transfer and the Credit Value Date for the outward transfer).</p>
            <p>The Value Date conditions applicable to the Customer entry (Debit Value Date for outward transfers and the Credit Value Date for the inward transfers) are then defined by specifying a number of days to be added (Inward Payments) or subtracted (Outward Payments) from the bank Value Date.</p>
            <p>2. The User can also define different Default Value Date conditions for groups of Customers in the Group Condition table. This table will be referenced by the User, when it is required to apply special conditions to particular groups of Customers (as Banks, Staff, Prime Customers, etc...).</p>
            <p>3. Default Value Date conditions can also be defined at the Customer level by means of the Customer Condition table. The User will refer to this table when any particular Customer is to receive special conditions.</p>
            <p>4. When the Value Date is not input, the Funds Transfer Application will verify (each time) whether the Customer has special Value Date conditions, or is part of a group of Customers which have been afforded special conditions, and if not, apply the Transaction Type default Value Date conditions.</p>
            <p>To summarise the priority sequence of conditions:</p>
            <p>if not INPUT then CUSTOMER, if not CUSTOMER then GROUP, if not GROUP then TXN TYPE.</p>
            <p>For the Default Value Dates, the Application will first generate the Value Date Applicable to the bank (Debit Value Date of inward transfers and Credit value date for outward transfers) and then calculate the Customer, Credit or Debit, Value Date according to the number of days float defined in the appropriate tables.</p>
            <p>Debit value dates on outgoing funds transfers can also be calculated by setting the CUT.OFF.RULE field on the AGENCY file and the CUT.OFF.TIME field on the CURRENCY file. For this method to be applied CUT.OFF.RULE must be set to a value of 0 or 1 and CUT.OFF.TIME must be set to a valid time. If these fields are set and no debit value date is entered, the calculated date will be applied, if a debit value date has been entered and it is before the calculated date then an override will be requested.</p>
            <p>Note : If there is no record in the Holiday table for the country of the debit currency, the Value Date will be checked against the Local Holiday table record. If the Local Holiday table record is also missing, the transfer will be rejected.</p>

            <p>The Debit Value Date cannot be greater than the Credit Value Date except for AC type transactions that have the DB.AFTER.CR field set to Yes. </p>
            <p>For the Inward Payment Orders, an override will be required when the Debit Value Date is before the Processing date. </p>
            <p>The Value Date of this field will be checked against the Holiday table of the country of the debit Currency. Any non-working day will require an override. </p>
            <p>For Inward transaction types, if the Transaction Type condition table specifies 'NO' default value date, input in this field is mandatory. </p>
            <p>If CUT.OFF.TIME (CURRENCY file) and CUT.OFF.RULE (AGENCY file) have both been set then the default debit value date for an outgoing funds transfer will be calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p />
            <p>if the transaction is entered before the cut off time specified on the currency file (for the debit currency) and CUT.OFF.RULE is set to 0, then the debit value date will be today&amp;#8217;s date, if CUT.OFF.RULE is set to 1, then the debit value date will be today&amp;#8217;s date +1 working day.</p>
            <p />
            <p>if the transaction is entered after the cut off time specified on the currency file (for the debit currency) and CUT.OFF.RULE is set to 0, then the debit value date will be the next working day, if CUT.OFF.RULE is set to 1, then the debit value date will be the next working day +1 working day</p>
            <p />
            <p>if neither the credit or debit value date have been entered and the default debit value date is after the default credit value date then the credit value date will be set to the default debit value date</p>

            <p>Input allowed only when the Customer Rate is not entered.</p>
            <p>The User should consider the rules relating to the default values of Spread by the Funds Transfer Application. These rules can be summarized as:</p>
            <p>1. The Currency Table allows the User to define different Treasury and Customer exchange Spreads according to the amount of the transaction. The Customer Spreads from this table will be used throughout the Funds Transfer Application when no other special spread conditions have been afforded to the Customer of the transaction.</p>
            <p>2. The User can define different spread conditions for groups of Customers by use of the Group Condition table. This table will be enhanced by the User so as to apply special conditions to particular groups of Customers (as Banks, staff, Prime Customers, etc.).</p>
            <p>3. Finally, default spread conditions can also be defined at the Customer level by means of an individual customer record on the GROUP.CONDITION table. The User will create entries on this table when a particular Customer receives special conditions.</p>
            <p>4. The default spread as calculated above is recalculated with the difference between Treasury Rate and Customer Rate, when Customer Rate is entered . In such cases, Customer Spread can be Positive or Negative based on the difference between Customer Rate and Treasury Rate.</p>
            <p>When spread is negative then Market exchange profit will show a Negative amount implying the Loss.</p>
            <p>Any input by the User will supercede the applicable default conditions. Any direct input will be subjected to certain range checks.</p>

            <p>Let us suppose an outgoing transfer by telex where the customer asks to transfer the equivalent of CHF2000 in French francs with the following exchange rates:</p>
            <p>-    Cross Rate Treasury=4,0943            -    Cross Rate Customer=4,0533            -    Mid Rate GBP/CHF=2,44            -    Treasury Rate GBP/FRF=9,99</p>
            <p>Field Name         Value</p>

            <p>It can be seen that:</p>
            <p>1) The AMOUNT.DEBITED (BASE.CURRENCY) has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>2) The AMOUNT.CREDITED (non base currency) has been converted at the treasury rate of 9,99.</p>
            <p>3) The TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>4) The TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>5) The MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT, when charges and commissions are booked in a separate entry, is derived from the difference between the           LOC.AMT.DEBITED and the LOC.AMT.CREDITED.</p>

            <p>The number automatically generated in Field 92.1 is unique to the transaction in question and is built in the following way:</p>
            <p>1. The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days since the 1st of January 1968. In our example, it corresponds to the 11th of June 1986.</p>
            <p>2. The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of seconds since midnight. In our example, it corresponds to an entry generated on line at 09:04:44 AM.</p>
            <p>3. The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds of seconds.</p>
            <p>The value assigned (again automatically) to field 103.2 identifies the number in 103.1 as a statement entry number. If the User wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen the User will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and then type the following at 'Awaiting ID':</p>
            <p>673732684.480001</p>
            <p>where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first statement entry (there will normally be more than one as the next example will illustrate).</p>
            <p>Example 2:</p>
            <p>A second example outlined here is similar to that in example A in that there is a statement entry on value date for both the our account and the customer account. The system handles this case as follows:</p>
            <p>103.1 STMT.NO .......... 673732684.48 103.2 STMT.NO .......... 1-2</p>
            <p>Once again field 103.1 contains the identification number automatically generated by the system while field 103.2 now contains two separate numbers signifying that there are in fact two separate statement entries, one in respect of the our account pay and one in respect of the our account receive. If the User wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at 'Awaiting ID' type EITHER:</p>
            <p>673732684.480001</p>
            <p>where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the statement entry in respect of the our account OR</p>
            <p>673732684.480002</p>
            <p>where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the statement entry in respect of the customer account.</p>
            <p>Example 3:</p>
            <p>A third example might be that of a category entry generated at initiation of a Funds Transfer transaction where commission or charges have been debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss category code. In this case the following entries are generated on the transaction:</p>
            <p>103.1 STMT.NO .......... 673732684.48 103.3 STMT.NO .......... 1</p>
            <p>Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at Field 103.1.</p>
            <p>Now, however, Field 103.2 is replaced by Field 92.3 which now identifies the number in 103.1 as a category entry and not a statement entry.</p>
            <p>To call this category entry record onto the screen the User must now type:</p>
            <p>CATEG.ENTRY at 'Awaiting Application'</p>
            <p>followed by:</p>
            <p>673732684.480001 at 'Awaiting ID'.</p>

            <p>D = Debit plus Commission The Debit plus Commission value will indicate that, for outgoing payments, the complete transfer amount will be remitted to the receiver bank and the commissions amount will be collected from our ordering Customer. For incoming payments, the complete transfer amount will be credited to our beneficiary Customer and the commission amount will be debited to the Account defaulted or specified in Charges Account Number.</p>
            <p>C = Credit less Commission The Credit less Commission value will indicate that, for outgoing payments, the amount of commission will be deducted from the Transfer Amount which is remitted to the receiver bank. For Incoming payments, the amount of commission will be deducted from the received amount (Transfer amount) and credited to a Profit and Loss Category code. If the Customer has requested the bank to apply all commissions and charges to a separate account, the complete Transfer Amount will be credited to one account and the corresponding commissions and charges debited to the specific charge/ commission account of the Customer.</p>
            <p>W = Waive Commission The Waive Commission value will indicate that no commission is to be applied on this transaction. Any input in the fields Commission Type and Commission Amount will consequently be refused.</p>
            <p>Example of Credit Less Commissions. One of our Customers requests the bank to pay USD 10,000.00 less the commission and our commission amount is USD 10.00.</p>
            <p>We will debit our Customer for USD 10,000.00, credit the appropriate Nostro account for 9,990.00 USD (which will be the Transfer amount) and credit our commission Profit and Loss category code for USD 10.00 (or equivalent in local Currency if different from USD).</p>
            <p>Note : For Standing Order transfers and any transfers with Nostro for both Debit and Credit Accounts, the default value generated is W (Waive Commission).</p>

            <p>C, D or W - see Details. (Optional input. Default values are: D for outgoing payments or C for incoming payments, W for any transfer with Nostro accounts for both Debit and Credit). For Outward Payments where the Debit Account is either a Profit and Loss Category Code or an internal Account, both the Commission Code and Charge Code must equate to Waive, unless the Charges Acct No is specified. For Inward Payments, where the Credit Account is either a Profit and Loss Category Code or an internal account, both the Commission Code and Charge Code must equate to Waive. Entry of a Waive Commission Code will not be allowed if any Commission Types have been entered.

<field>TREASURY.RATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the rate at which the Treasury unit will buy or sell foreign Currency from/to the marketing units.</p>
            <p>The Funds Transfer Application will make use of a Treasury Rate each time a transaction involves a conversion of currencies.</p>
            <p>The Final exchange rate quoted to Customers (Customer Rate) will be determined by the addition or subtraction of the appropriate Customer Spread to/from the Treasury Buy/Sell Rate.</p>
            <p>A detailed explanation of the function of these fields can be found in the Currency Table Overview.</p>
            <p>The Default Treasury Rate will be as per Currency table depending on value of transaction.</p>
            <p>When a rate has been obtained from a Dealer, the reference of an associated FX deal, optionally may be input in the next field Negotiated Dealer Reference.</p>
            <p>

(Optional input where exchange calculation involved otherwise not allowed).</p>
            <p>It is important to understand that this field represents the Treasury Rate and not the final Customer Rate. The latter will always be calculated by the System and will be stored in the Customer Rate field.</p>
            <p>The Calculated Customer Rate must be positive, see CUSTOMER.SPREAD.</p>
            <p>If the Amount of the transaction exceeds the Negotiable Amount, above which an exchange rate should be obtained from the dealer, the System requests that rate to be entered. Otherwise, if the Treasury Rate field is left blank for amounts in excess of the limit, as defined in the Currency table, an override will be requested and the Application will default to the appropriate Currency Market Buy or Sell rate. In this situation, no additional Treasury Spread is applied from the Currency Table.</p>
            <p>If the todays fixing rates have not yet been entered in the Currency table, an override message will be displayed asking the User if the existing exchange rates are to be used. If the previous rate is not to be used, the transaction will be placed in a INORATE Funds Transfer status (Input but No Rate) awaiting subsequent authorisation and release. Such a transaction can be authorised, in which case the status will be changed to ANORATE.</p>
            <p>If the exchange rate of the Currency is blocked (e.g. the dealers have suspended quoting a rate in a particular Currency), the transaction will be rejected up to the time that the currency code has been set to normal use again.</p>

In this case the            total of all commission, charges and taxes will be deducted            from the Credit Amount to determine the Amount credited.</p>
            <p>2. When the Debit Amount field has been input, the Amount Credited will be the Debit Amount converted, if necessary, into            the credit Currency.  If the Charges Account number was Null            and the Commission or Charges codes specify Credit Less            Charges, the total of all the commission, charges and taxes            will be deducted from the converted Debit Amount to determine            the Amount Credited.</p>

<field>DEBIT.CURRENCY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Defines the Currency of the Account being debited.</p>
            <p>For Inward Payment Orders, this field usually represents the Currency of the Payment Order (i.e. the Currency of the Nostro account which will be debited). For Outward Payment Orders, this field will represent the Currency of the Customer account which is debited to fund the payment transaction.</p>
            <p>For Outward Payment Orders, this field together with the Debit Amount field could represent the Transfer Currency and Transfer Amount where the Customer has not specified the actual amount to be transferred, but instead, has requested the Bank to pay the equivalent of the defined amount in another specified Currency.</p>
            <p>Example:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose that British Bank received a Payment Order from a Customer who requests the Bank to pay in dollars the equivalent of GBP 10,000.00 to Mr Carter who has an account with American Bank, N.Y. The following will then be input:</p>
            <p>Debit Account No. 123456 Debit Currency GBP Debit Amount 10,000.00 Credit Currency USD</p>
            <p>The Application will then automatically calculate the corresponding amount to be transferred in Dollars using the appropriate Buy/Sell exchange rate from the Currency table.</p>

            <p>Input will be mandatory when the Debit Amount is entered.</p>
            <p>The Currency, if input, must be equal to the local Currency or the Credit Currency, if the debit account no         is a profit and loss category code (indicated by         preceeding PL).</p>

            <p>When FT's processed through OFS and user wants to wait for the exchange rates since the Fixing Date is less than today then Incoming OFS message should populate AUTO.EXCH.RATE.IND as "AWAIT", which will create FT contract in ANORATE status.</p>

            <p>Foreign currency charge amounts will always update the Asset and Liability Exchange position at the middle rate.  In these present conditions, the value of this field must always be equal to the value of the field 'LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT'.</p>
            <p>The following example (including 2 foreign currencies) will clarify the conversion of foreign currency amounts into their local currency equivalent:</p>
            <p>Let us suppose an outgoing transfer by telex where the customer asks to transfer the equivalent of CHF2000 in French francs with the following exchange rates:</p>
            <p>-    Cross Rate Treasury=4,0943            -    Cross Rate Customer=4,0533            -    Mid Rate GBP/CHF=2,44            -    Treasury Rate GBP/FRF=9,99</p>
            <p>Field Name         Value</p>
            <p>DEBIT.CURRENCY     CHF DEBIT.AMOUNT       2,000.00 CREDIT.CURRENCY    FRF CHARGES.ACCT.NO    3336  CUR/ACC CHF AMOUNT.DEBITED     CHF 2,000.00 AMOUNT.CREDITED    FRF 8,106.56 TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT   CHF    72.06 TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT   CHF     7.66 LOC.AMT.DEBITED    (GBP) 819.67 LOC.AMT.CREDITED   (GBP) 811.47 LOC.TOT.TAX.AMT    (GBP)   3.14 LOCAL.CHARGE.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 LOC.POS.CHGS.AMT   (GBP)  29.54 MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT           8.20</p>
            <p>It can be seen that:</p>
            <p>1) The AMOUNT.DEBITED (BASE.CURRENCY) has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>2) The AMOUNT.CREDITED (non base currency) has been converted at the treasury rate of 9,99.</p>
            <p>3) The TOTAL.CHARGE.AMT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>4) The TOTAL.TAX.AMOUNT has been converted at the middle rate of 2,44.</p>
            <p>5) The MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT, when charges and commissions are booked in a separate entry, is derived from the difference between the           LOC.AMT.DEBITED and the LOC.AMT.CREDITED.</p>

            <p>When data is present in this field, a further telex will be sent in addition to the messages normally produced when the transaction is being processed by the Delivery Application.</p>
            <p>A typical use of this function, would be the sending of a direct telex advice to the Beneficiary when one of the Customers requests the Bank to make an Outward Payment under direct telex advice to  the Beneficiary.</p>
            <p>When the receiver of the message does not exist on the Customer file, the User may directly input the Name and Address details of the intended receiver of the message.  In this case the User should also supply the telex number (where available) to enable the Repair Function in the Delivery System to work.</p>
            <p>For any free format telex, the Funds Transfer Application will automatically apply the default Secondary Telex Charge Code, from the Application Default File.  It is important, if the Bank is to charge for such cables, that this code is present on the Application Default File.</p>
            <p>This charge is to be taken in addition to those specifically entered, or defaulted, within Funds Transfer main processing.</p>
            <p>The Charge code, from the Application default file, must be a valid code in the Charge Type table such that the applicable charge may be derived according to standard Charge Type processing.</p>

            <p>Input will only be allowed when the default Secondary Telex Charge Code is present in the Application Default File.</p>
            <p>If the input in this field is less than 11 characters, the system will interpret the input as a Customer Mnemonic and try to find a Customer accordingly.  For this reason, any free text used to input manually the name and address of the receiver of the free message must exceed 10 characters.</p>

<field>CHARGE.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Charge Types which are applicable to the transaction being processed. If no input is made in these fields, the Application will default the Charge Types.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>The rules relating to the handling of the default Charge Types by the Funds Transfer Application can be summarised as follows:</p>
            <p />
            <p>1. For each Transaction Type, default Charge Type conditions may be defined in the Transaction Type table. The User may define in this table all Charge Types applicable to each Transaction Type.</p>
            <p />
            <p>2. The User can also define different Charge Type conditions for groups of Customers in the Group Condition table. This table will be enhanced by the User when special conditions are to be applied to particular groups of Customers (e.g. Banks, staff, Prime Customers, etc.).</p>
            <p />
            <p>3. Finally, default Charge Type conditions can also be defined at the individual Customer level by means of the Customer Condition table. The User will create entries in this table when a particular Customer is to receive special conditions.</p>
            <p />
            <p>When no Charge Types are input via the screen, the Funds Transfer Application will verify if the Customer has special Charge Type conditions or whether the Customer is part of a group of Customers which have been afforded special conditions. Else it will apply the Transaction Type default Charge Type conditions.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Any direct input by the User will, however, override the applicable default conditions and will become the only Charge Type data to be applied to the transaction. In such a situation the Charge Type code will be used only as enrichment when a Charge amount has been entered in the next field or if left blank the amount will be calculated from the values held in the Charge Type entry.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Incase of Txn.Types involving Message.Type 103, then charges are defaulted from CORR.BANK.CHARGES application setup as defined for the Credit currency and as applicable for the Credit Customer or Receiver Bank Customer and Txn.type combination for outward Message provided the BEN.OUR.CHARGES is "OUR". Incase of inward Customer is checked against sender of MT103 message.</p>
            <p />
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p />
            <p>2 character Charge Type (alphanumeric) - type A. Associated multivalue field. (Optional input. See Details for default) The Charge Type input in this field must exist in the Charge Type table. When this field is input the input of an amount will be allowed. If the type is entered with no amount then the values of the code in the charge file are used in the associated CHARGE.AMOUNT field. If no data is entered the User can view all the standard default Charge Types and associated amounts generated by the Application by specifying Yes in the CHARGE.COM.DISPLAY field.</p>
            <p />
            <p>If BEN.OUR.CHARGES = BEN and the system has been set to produce swift MESSAGE MT103 Single Customer Credit Transfer via the transaction type and FT.TXN.TYPE.CONDITION then this field is mandatory.</p>

            <p>METHOD = STANDARD The allocation of exchange earnings is made automatically between Treasury and Marketing units at the time of the transaction. Any profit relating to the Marketing area (i.e. Customer spread) is credited to the Profit and Loss (see later for calculation of category code) immediately and the transaction is effectively booked at Treasury Buy/Sell rates.  All exchange profit on revaluation will therefore accrue to the Treasury area. More information, if needed, can be found in the Currency table.</p>
            <p>The Marketing exchange profit will only be applicable on the TRANSFER amount and when the Credit Currency differs to the Debit Currency. Foreign currency charge amounts will always be converted at the middle rate and therefore will not produce Marketing Exchange profit.</p>
            <p>The Profit and Loss entry will be booked with the transaction code 200 if it is a credit or 201 if it is a debit.</p>
            <p>Also note that when the charges and commissions are booked in a separate entry, the Marketing Exchange Profit, MKTG.EXCH.PROFIT, is derived directly from the difference between the LOC.AMT.DEBITED and the LOC.AMT.CREDITED</p>
            <p />
            <p>METHOD = MIDDLE The TRANSFER amount is calculated according to the DEAL.MARKET where the transfer is accross currencies. Local equivalents of the debit and credit amounts in the respective currencies are calculated using the rate applicable to the respective DR and CR currency markets. The difference in local equivalents (LOC.AMT.DEBITED and LOC.AMT.CREDITED) is booked to the marketing exchange profit P&amp;L immediately.</p>
            <p />
            <p>ALLOCATION of P&amp;L CATEGORY code The P&amp;L code used for booking is derived as follows:       - Check ACCOUNT.CLASS records FTMKTEXCHxx where xx is DR or CR         according to whether a profit or loss is calculated. The defined         CATEGORY will be used if the record is present.       - Check ACCOUNT.CLASS records MKTEXCHxx where xx is DR or CR         according to whether a profit or loss is calculated. The defined         CATEGORY will be used if the record is present.       - Where no category has been derived 53006 will be used.</p>
