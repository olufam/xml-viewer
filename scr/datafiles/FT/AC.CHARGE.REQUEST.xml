            <p>Charge Request is a fully integrated module with the T24 environment to provide advanced banking services to the user. Used as an interbank facility for requesting or advising charges of many types from other financial institutions.</p>
            <p>Instructions are entered manually by the user and the system will fully interact with the internal Delivery Module and Swift. The Charge Request module will calculate any tax or commission that should apply to the charge and then process the requested SWIFT and update accounting records.</p>

<field>REMOVE.DATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is populated automatically by T24 when a status is entered that means the Charge Request record can safely be moved to history. </p>
            <p>Whilst the date in the field will be set to today's date, this does not mean the record will be written away immediately. Recently changed deals are often the subject of client enquiries so the records need to be kept on the live file for a short period.</p>

            <p>HLD.RPT.RETENTION </p>

<field>REQUEST.ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies uniquely each Charge Request transaction. </p>
            <p>The Reference Number will be shown on all output generated from the transaction. </p>
            <p>To avoid the necessity to input the complete Reference Number, the User has the facility to input only the sequence number of the transaction to access any transaction which has been input that day. The Application will automatically generate the seven first digits and append them to the front of the sequence number in order to retrieve the requested transaction. </p>
            <p>Access to any Charge Request transaction from a previous day requires the input of the day number and sequence number, the system will automatically generate the first 5 characters, assuming that the current year is applicable. </p>
            <p><strong>Explanation of Reference Number format</strong>: CHGYYDDDNNNNN </p>
            <p>CHG - Application indicator for the Charge Request Module.. YY - Last two digits of year when transaction is processed. DDD - Julian day number within year when the AC.CHARGE.REQUEST is processed. NNNNN - Five digit sequential number. </p>
            <p>This range will allow up to 99,999 Charge Request transactions to be entered on each single day. Thus: CHG8530500010 is the 10th Charge Request transaction of the 2nd of November 1985, i.e.: - CHG = Charge Request Module Id. - 85 = Year 1985 - 305 = 2nd of November (305th day 1985) - 00010 = 10th transaction on that day. </p>

            <p>11 numeric characters, prefixed by CHG: CHGyydddnnnnn         i.e. CHG followed by 10 numbers(see Details for further         explanation). (Mandatory input)</p>
