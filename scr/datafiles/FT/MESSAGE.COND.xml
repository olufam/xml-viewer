            <p>The file allows, for a given SWIFT message type, restrictions to be defined which will prevent the output of the message via the delivery system. These restrictions may be defined to be conditional on the currency and amount to which the message relates or on the customer who is to be its recipient. </p>
            <p>IMPORTANT NOTE: THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION OF MESSAGE CONDITION CHECKING APPLIES ONLY TO NOTICE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES (210'S) GENERATED BY THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE APPLICATION. </p>
