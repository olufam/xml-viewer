<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The purpose of this table is to identify, by means of a User defined Funds Transfer General Condition number, a specific group of Customers which will then be cross-related to the Group Condition Table to define Funds Transfers conditions applicable to that group.  The FT General Condition record must exist before any associated Group Condition can be specified. The key to this table, is also the key to the associated FT Group Condition record. </p>
            <p>To create a Group Condition,the user must identify the Group by means of the General Condition number defined in this table.  The Group of Customers will then be identified by means of the details held within this table. </p>
            <p>For a Customer to be selected, it must conform to every field value defined within the Funds Transfer General Condition to qualify for a specific Group.  Amending a Customer or Account record may therefore result in reclassification of the Customer (or Account) into another Group or even to return to the 'normal conditions'. </p>
            <p>Amendments to this table will only take effect after the user has next signed on to the system. </p>

<field>VALUE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field contains the actual value </p>
            <p>If the associated PRTY.VALIDATION field on CONDITION.PRIORITY has been defined as a FILE&gt;FIELD.NAME then the value entered must exist as a key on the file mentioned and the field name will be the enrichment for the VALUE field.</p>
            <p>For example if ACCOUNT&gt;CATEGORY is set in PRT.VALIDATION on CONDIITON.PRIORITY record , then the value input in this field should  have an entry in CATEGORY file. </p>
            <p>If the associated PRTY.VALIDATION field on CONDITION.PRIORITY has been defined as a @routine.name then this routine will be run to check if the value entered is valid. </p>
            <p />
            <p>e.g.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>On the CONDITION PRIORITY record.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>3.1 PRIORITY.ITEM is CUSTOMER&gt;SECTOR.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>4.1 PRTY.VALIDATION is SECTOR&gt;DESCRIPTION</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>Then on XX.GEN.CONDITION record </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>2.1.1 ITEM is CUSTOMER&gt;SECTOR.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>3.1.1 PRIORITY is 1</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>4.1.1VALUE is 1000</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>Then the value 1000 will be checked against the SECTOR file and if there is record for 1000 then the DESCRIPTION will be displayed as an enrichment otherwise the value will be rejected with a record missing message.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Thus if the SECTOR code record was for Private Customers then</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>4.1.1VALUE is 1000</p>
