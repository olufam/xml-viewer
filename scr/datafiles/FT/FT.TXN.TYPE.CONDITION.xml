<ovdesc>

            <p>This table defines the default conditions for each Transaction Type which can be processed by the Funds Transfer and Standing Orders Application. These can be summarised as follows: </p>
            <p>           Transaction Codes </p>
            <p>           The Transaction Codes to be used for the generation of the            entries.  Both Debit and Credit Transaction Codes will be            defined for basic entries, standing orders, debit charges and            cheques. </p>
            <p />
            <p>           Commission Types </p>
            <p>           The default Commission Types applicable for each Transaction            Type.  These Commission Types must first have been defined in            the Commission Type table. </p>
            <p />
            <p>           Charge Types </p>
            <p>           The default Charge Types applicable for each Transaction type.            These Charge Types must have been previously created in the            CHARGE.TYPE table. </p>
            <p />
            <p>           Maximum Forward and Back Value Date </p>
            <p>           The Maximum Forward and Back Value dates applicable for each            transaction type must be specified and any excess beyond these            value dates will force an override at the transaction level. </p>
            <p />
            <p>           Default Value Dates for the Accounting Entries </p>
            <p>           The default Value Date conditions may be held for each            Transaction type.  The conditions for both debit and credit            entries are catered for, i.e the User can specify for each            Transaction type, the Value Date conditions applicable to the            bank and to the Customer. </p>
            <p />
            <p>           Production of Advices </p>
            <p>           For a given transaction type, the production of Debit and            Credit advices by default, can be controlled. </p>
            <p>The default conditions defined in this table will only be used by the Funds Transfer Application, during validation of the transaction, if specific values have not been manually entered during the transaction input stage. </p>
            <p>Amendments to this table will only take effect after the user has next signed on to the system. </p>

<field>TRANSACTION.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This record is used in FUNDS.TRANSFER to set field usage and options specific to a certain type of Funds Transfer. There are obvious differences between a simple Account Transfer and a fully detailed International Electronic Payment involving many counterparties so the options in each can differ and need unique options, this record allows those options to be configured as required.</p>
            <p>Whilst there are standard codes which can be used (as detailed in the table below) it is also possible for the user to define custom codes. These can be up to 4 characters but must have the first 2 characters of one of the standard codes. </p>
            <p>For example the code OT can be used for standard Outward Payments, whilst OTSW allows the option to specify BIC codes on and OT03 sends an MT103 instead of an MT100.</p>

            <p>(a), (bb), (c) specify the number of calendar or working days to be subtracted from the Processing Date in order to obtain the Maximum Back Value Date/Exposure date  as follows: </p>
            <p>           (a)   -  If days are to be subtracted from the Run Date.  Only                     the '-' sign will be allowed for this field. </p>
            <p>           (bb) 01-99 Indicates the number of days to be subtracted. </p>

            <p>If it is necessary to subtract any other days to those specified in (bb) before obtaining the Maximum back Value Date/Exposure date then (d), (ee), (f) are used as follows: </p>

            <p>This field allows you to specify a Maximum back Value or Exposure Date for this Transaction Type being either the Processing Date, or a number of working or calendar days to be subtracted from the Processing Date.  This prevents the operator from inputting a Value Date or an Exposure Date which exceeds an acceptable period for this type of transaction. </p>
            <p>Any Funds Transfer payment input for the Transaction Type with a Back Value date greater than that specified in this field must be overridden. </p>
            <p>Example:   A Default Value Date of -03W would be 3 working days            backwards. </p>
            <p>     or    -01W -02C would be 1 working day plus 2 calendar days            backwards. </p>
            <p>Note : The date specified in this field may not be earlier than the Back        Value Maximum as specified in the Dates file. </p>

            </p>
            <p>Y If the Maximum Back Value or Exposure Date is to be the Processing Date.  N or NO Where no special maximum is required.  The Back Value         minimum as specified in the Dates file will apply.  or (a) (bb) (c) (d) (ee) (f) As defined.  (Optional input;  Default = None).</p>
