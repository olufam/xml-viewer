            <p>This application allows Funds Transfer to be customised to the requirements of particular local clearing systems. </p>
            <p>Details specified will be used only by the BC transaction type within FUNDS.TRANSFER, and by the delivery system for diversion of other payment messages into the clearing system. </p>
            <p>Field specifications can be redefined for the FUNDS TRANSFER application. Maximum and minimum field lengths, maximum number of lines for multivalued fields, and validation of input against another file can be specified. This ensures that the data entered conforms with the local clearing system specifications. </p>
            <p>Special routines for cross validation, delivery output and accounting within Funds Transfer can be defined here. </p>
            <p>Any interface with the clearing system from the T24 delivery system should also be defined here. Payment message types which are to be diverted into the local clearing system can be specified. </p>
            <p>Once defined for a particular clearing system, the record should not require any site specific changes. </p>
