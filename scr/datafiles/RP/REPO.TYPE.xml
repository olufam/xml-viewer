            <p>The characteristics of different types of Repo contracts are defined here, and records on this file are referenced from the main contract file REPO.</p>
            <p> The TRANSACTION.INDEX determines whether the contract is treated as a Repo (a cash deposit) or as a Reverse Repo (cash loan), and is linked to the PRODUCT.CATEGORY that defaults onto the contract itself.</p>
            <p> This category code may be used to differentiate between contract types for reporting purposes.</p>
            <p> The suffix used to determine the default margin portfolio is defined here.</p>

<field>PRODUCT.CATEGORY</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is used to specify the default product category that will be used for the type of Repo contract to which this record refers. The product category is defaulted into the Repo contract, and is used to determine whether the cash side of the contract is a loan or a deposit.</p>

            <p> Where the product category indicates a DEPOSIT, the repo type refers to a REPO contract.</p>
            <p> Where the product category indicates a LOAN, the repo type refers to a REVERSE REPO contract.</p>
            <p> This field is closely linked to the TRANSACTION.INDEX field that holds the text "LOAN" or "DEPOSIT" to clarify the product category.</p>
            <p> The TRANSACTION.INDEX and the product category must agree. Refer to the Rules.</p>

            <p> Where the default margin portfolio does not exist, the MARGIN.PORTFOLIO must be entered into the REPO contract.</p>
            <p> It is this portfolio that is used to determine if a margin call is required (or is to be expected) and as such should contain no other holdings except those from the REPO application.</p>

As such the cash side of the contract should be shown below the line. On the REPO contract itself, the BANK.PORTFOLIO field becomes no input. Instead the field CUST.PORTFOLIO is used to determine the customer's portfolio that will supply the securities.</p>
            <p> The SECURITY.TRANSFER performed under this type of contract is carried out Delivery Against Payment, and as such the cash side of the contract is considered to be notional, with an internal account being used for the accounting.</p>
