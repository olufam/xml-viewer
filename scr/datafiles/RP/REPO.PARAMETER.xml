            <p>If NO or NULL is selected,</p>
            <p>The SECURITY.TRANSFER record for both legs of the REPO contract will get generated n days before the value date or maturity date of the repo contract</p>

            <p>2. The security transfer record for the far leg of the REPO contract will get generated n days before the actual maturity date of the repo contract</p>

<desc>
            <p>This field states the number of days after maturity that a contract is removed from the live file and written to History. A typical input would be 30 so that monthly reports could include contracts that matured during the month without having to interrogate History files.</p>

<field>REPO.LIMIT.UPDATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>A REPO contract is treated as a loan of securities and a deposit of cash. However, the bank may see the loan of the securities as a potential risk, and may wish a repo contract to update the T24 limit processing as if it were a loan - thus decreasing the available limit.</p>
            <p>This field allows the user to define whether the limit for a REPO is regarded as either a LOAN or a DEPOSIT.</p>
