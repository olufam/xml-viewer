<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The LMM.SCHEDULES file is a diary for all authorised contracts in the Money Market and Loans system.  Each record contains a list of the scheduled activities that are due to occur on a particular date for a specific contract.  Each contract can have many LMM.SCHEDULES records because there are many activities that can occur on many dates throughout the life of a contract. </p>
            <p>The type of information that each record contains is always of the "trigger" variety. i.e. It acts as a trigger to the end of day (off-line) to perform a particular process or activity.  The types of activities are as follows: </p>
            <p>      (i)   Financial Movements            e.g. principal drawdowns, principal or            interest liquidations. </p>
            <p>     (ii)   Sending of payments            i.e. sending payment instructions relating            to a financial movement. </p>
            <p>    (iii)   Rate Revisions            i.e. revising the rate at which interest            is accrued. </p>
            <p>All updates to this file are effected automatically by the system and the only functions users are allowed to perform are (L)IST, (E)XCEPTION, (S)EE and (P)RINT. </p>
            <p>As soon as a particular schedule has been processed by the End of Day it is usually deleted form the LMM.SCHEDULES file and a record with the same key is written to the LMM.SCHEDULE.PAST file.  The only exception to this is when a Schedule record includes a 'Sending of Payment' activity.  In this case, the 'Sending of Payment' part of the Schedule remains on the LMM.SCHEDULES file until the financial Schedule, to which it relates, is also processed. </p>
            <p>For example, if a Payment has to be sent two days prior to the value date of the payment (DAYS DELIVERY field in CURRENCY table) then any Sending of Payment activity will remain on the LMM.SCHEDULES file for two working days after it has been processed. </p>

<field>NOTE.DENOM</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the denomination of Notes which will be repurchased as part of a new Bond Issue. </p>
            <p>Together with the field NOTE.QUANTITY, this field specifies the value of Bonds repurchased at this denomination. The total value of the notes purchesd,must equal the associated AMOUNT. A Bond issue may contain notes of different denominations so this field is sub-valued to allow such cases to be defined. </p>
            <p>When a scheduled repayment takes place the system will attempt to reduce the value of the notes according to the denominations specifeid here and in NOTE.QUANT. </p>
            <p>If it is not possible to allocate the amounts accross the denominations, an exception message will be raised. </p>

<field>TYPE.I</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies whether there is an interest movement due on this scheduled date or not. </p>
            <p>If an interest movement is due to occur on a contract on a particular date then this field will contain a 'Y' on the Contracts LMM.SCHEDULES record for the scheduled date.  Whenever the Contract details specify that interest is due on a particular date, irrespective of whether the interest is then to be liquidated, capitalized or deferred, then this field will contain a 'Y' on the appropriate schedule record.  This is also true for non-interest bearing contracts such as account receivables and Sundry deposits because the system always assumes that every contract has an interest period.  It is only when the schedule is processed by the 'End of Day' that the system finds that there is no committed interest and therefore nothing to process. </p>

<field>TYPE.S</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies whether there could be a payment instruction to send on this Schedule date or not. </p>
            <p>If during the future life of a Contract, funds have to be delivered to the Customer then this field will Contain a 'Y' 'n' days prior to the value date of the movement of funds. </p>
            <p>The number of days prior to the movement of funds value date is determined by the DAYS.DELIVERY in the payment CURRENCY record. </p>
            <p>This is best explained by means of an example: </p>
            <p>If a U.S. dollar deposit is due to mature on 11th March 1986 then a 'Financial Schedule' Will be written for the 11th March that includes type 'P' for Principal repayment, and type 'I' for interest payment. </p>
            <p>If the U.S. dollar currency record states that there should be '1' day delivery then any physical payment instruction that needs to be sent must be sent one day prior to the payment value date.  In the example above this means that should a payment instruction need to be sent to repay the deposit, then it needs to be sent on the 10th March. </p>
            <p>In order to 'trigger' this physical sending of a payment message, the system writes a Schedule 'type S' 'n' days prior to any movement of funds out of the bank.  The value for 'n' is derived from the days delivery field in the payment currency record and so continuing with the example above, a Schedule 'type S' will be written for 10th March. </p>
            <p>It should be noted that at the time of writing the Schedules, the system does not determine whether a physical payment instruction is required or not - it merely establishes the 'trigger'.  When the 'End of Day' processes the 'S' schedule then it reviews the settlement instructions and either writes a payment entry (which usually results in the sending of a payment instruction) or it does nothing if the account to credit is an internal or current account. </p>
            <p>To determine which financial movement any 'S' Schedule relates to, the next field 'S DATE', is completed with the schedule date of the financial movements. </p>

This is also true for non-interest bearing contracts such as account receivables and Sundry deposits because the system always assumes that every contract has an interest period.

        <p>TYPE.P</p>

If a principal movement is due to occur on a Contract on a particular date then this field will contained a 'Y' on the Contracts LMM.SCHEDULES record for the scheduled date. The only types of Scheduled Principal Movements that can occur in the Money Market system are Principal drawdowns, Principal increases and Principal repayments. A 'Y' will appear in this field for any of these types of movements. Although the statement entries/LMM.ACCOUNT.BALANCES movements will take effect on the scheduled date it should be noted that the new Principal amount of a contract will only affect the interest accrual according to the method of accrual. </p>

        <p>TYPE.R</p>

If a new interest rate or spread is to be applied to the Contract on a particular date then this field will contain a 'Y' on the Contracts LMM.SCHEDULES record for the Scheduled date. The new rate or spread is shown in the following field called INT EFFECT RATE. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> Only values are 'Y' meaning yes there is a rate revision; or blank meaning there is not.</p>
        <p>TYPE.S</p>
        <p>Specifies whether there could be a payment instruction to send on this Schedule date or not. If during the future life of a Contract, funds have to be delivered to the Customer then this field will Contain a 'Y' 'n' days prior to the value date of the movement of funds. The number of days prior to the movement of funds value date is determined by the DAYS.DELIVERY in the payment CURRENCY record. This is best explained by means of an example: If a U.S. dollar deposit is due to mature on 11th March 1986 then a 'Financial Schedule' Will be written for the 11th March that includes type 'P' for Principal repayment, and type 'I' for interest payment. If the U.S. dollar currency record states that there should be '1' day delivery then any physical payment instruction that needs to be sent must be sent one day prior to the payment value date. In the example above this means that should a payment instruction need to be sent to repay the deposit, then it needs to be sent on the 10th March. In order to 'trigger' this physical sending of a payment message, the system writes a Schedule 'type S' 'n' days prior to any movement of funds out of the bank. The value for 'n' is derived from the days delivery field in the payment currency record and so continuing with the example above, a Schedule 'type S' will be written for 10th March. It should be noted that at the time of writing the Schedules, the system does not determine whether a physical payment instruction is required or not - it merely establishes the 'trigger'. When the 'End of Day' processes the 'S' schedule then it reviews the settlement instructions and either writes a payment entry (which usually results in the sending of a payment instruction) or it does nothing if the account to credit is an internal or current account. To determine which financial movement any 'S' Schedule relates to, the next field 'S DATE', is completed with the schedule date of the financial movements. </p>
