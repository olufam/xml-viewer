            <p>LMM.TEXT is a table of advice texts which are printed on confirmations when settlement information, in respect of a contract counterparty, is not known. </p>
            <p>There are nine fields on each LMM.TEXT record.  Each has a related text which can be selected, by keying a number between 1 and 9, at the appropriate account field. </p>
            <p>This may be at the original input, or updating, of a Loan, Deposit or Money Market contract. </p>
            <p>This may be used, for example, when the User has no information about the counterparty's payment instructions and therefore, is unable to pay funds away.  In such a situation, the User would choose an appropriate text from the LMM.TEXT table (e.g. field 1 - Principal credited to suspense), and input  "1" at the appropriate account field when loading the contract. This message would then be printed on the contract confirmation under the settlement conditions heading. </p>
            <p>Only two records may be created on the LMM.TEXT table:- </p>
            <p>1.         TEXT RELATING TO PAYMENTS </p>
            <p>This will result in the credit of the LMM Suspense Credit Category Code defined on the ACCOUNT.CLASS record as "SUSPLMMCR". </p>
            <p>It is the TEXT (category) code that is used to form the suspense account number which is credited with the payment amount, and the advice narrative for the accompanying confirmation. </p>
            <p>2.         TEXT RELATING TO RECEIPTS </p>
            <p>This will result in the debit of the LMM Suspense Credit Category Code defined on the ACCOUNT.CLASS record as "SUSPLMMDR". </p>
            <p>It is the TEXT (category) code that is used to form the suspense account number which is debited with the payment amount, and the advice narrative for the accompanying confirmation. </p>

<field>CATEGORY.CODE</field>

            <p>The two category codes are to be found on the ACCOUNT.CLASS table, under the following titles:- </p>
            <p> i) SUSPLMMCR    For text related to payments, and                  therefore, having the key equal to                  the LMM Suspense Credit Category                  Code on the ACCOUNT.CLASS table. </p>
            <p>ii) SUSPLMMDR    For text related to receipts, and                  therefore, having the key equal to                  the LMM Suspense Debit Category Code                  on the ACCOUNT.CLASS table. </p>
