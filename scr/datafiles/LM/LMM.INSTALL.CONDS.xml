<ovdesc>

            <p>The LMM.INSTALL.CONDS table is a collection of parameters used by both the Money Market and Loans/Deposits systems when processing contract records.</p>
            <p>The key to this file is a valid COMPANY.CODE.</p>
            <p>The table consists of six major groups of conditions, each of which is further subdivided into a number of individual operating conditions. The six principal groups are:-</p>
            <p>DAYS BEFORE A STATUS CHANGE.    (fields 1 to 8)</p>
            <p>These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.</p>
            <p>DAYS BEFORE REPORTS.            (fields 9 to 11)</p>
            <p>These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.</p>
            <p>FIDUCIARIES.                    (fields 22 to 25)</p>
            <p>These fields are used by the Money Market system only.</p>
            <p>ACCOUNTING CONDITIONS.          (fields 26 to 28)</p>
            <p>These fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.</p>
            <p>CATEGORY CODES.                 (fields 29 to 89)</p>
            <p>The majority of these fields are used by the Loans and Deposits module only.</p>
            <p>Those used by Money Market are the Profit and Loss Category codes for interest paid and received.</p>
            <p>MISCELLANEOUS.                        (fields 12 to 21 and 90)</p>
            <p>These fields define conditions such as the number of days before a contract is written to History after it has matured; what to do if an account debit requires an override during the 'off-line', and various accrual options.</p>
            <p>The table overleaf gives a summary of those fields that are used by the Money Market Module AND/OR the Loans and Deposits Module:-</p>

<field>S.BASIS.RATE.VAL</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies whether validation will trap possible input errors when a rate is entered on the LD record. The rate is used as a check to help prevent errors through mis-keying the interest or commission amounts. Only applies where the calculation basis is 'S'.</p>
            <p>If this field is set to YES or left null the system will verify that the amount entered is within certain tolerance checks. If the amount is within a 1% tolerance it is accepted; over 1% but less than 5% an override will warn the user; if greater than 5% then the amount or rate were mis-keyed and the system will reject the amount (either the amount or check rate should be amended).</p>
            <p>Entering NO here will bypass these checks. This option should be used with care as mistakes can get through. It would be used where specific interest payment schedules are pre-defined that could fall foul of the validation.</p>

            <p />
            <p>If the interest is entered as USD 10T or USD 10M it would be rejected as it would be outside the 5% tolerance.</p>
            <p>USD 101T for this example would be over 1% and would generate an override.</p>

        <p>This field specifies the Profit and Loss Category code that is credited/debited when adjusting interest accruals for the previous months on an Asset contract where interest has been received in advance. When the system adjusts interest on an Asset contract then an entry is booked to the Profit and Loss Category code entered in this field for the previous months adjustment to the interest accrual. Adjustment of interest can be caused by events such as reversal of contract or use of the adjustment function. For example, if there is a back-valued interest rate reduction on an Asset contract then, if interest has accrued on this contract in the previous month at the old rate, there must be a debit to this Category code because too much interest has been accrued. The accrual cycle frequency is defined by the use of fields ACC CYCLE L CCY, ACC CYCLE F CCY and ACC CYCLE FLOAT in this record. </p>

When the system raises forward account movements, all future scheduled entries will be raised where possible. Future interest amounts will be calculated using the CURRENT interest rate, unless this field is set to YES. When this field is set to YES the next interest rate for future R (rate revision) schedules will be derived using the current PERIODIC.INTEREST tables. The derived rate will then be used in all future interest calculations. The interest figures reflected in the Position Management will be calculated according to the setting of this field. GAP figures for principal are only projected up to the next rate revision date where the rate is unknown, all further principal schedules are reported under the next rate revision date in this case. If this field is set to YES, since the rates will be projected, the GAP will now report all principal with the true dates. The information can be recalculated periodically according to the frequency defined in FWD.R.TYPE.FQU. All forward accounting and position management will be recalculated. </p>

First parameter is the input parameter that will hold Customer number and the second parameter is the output from the routine that would hold rollover flag indicating Y/N. The value in second parameter would decide the following A. 'N' indicates that rollover advice generation will happen based on DAYS.DELIVERY. B. 'Y' indicates that rollover advice will be generated on the rollover date. Should be a valid ID for a PGM.FILE with type 'S'. Maximum of 20 Characters. Optional input. Note: This field was created for the pupose of German Tax where rollover advices required to be generated only on the ROLLOVER.DATE for a specific condition i.e.non-bank CUSTOMERs and residence is 'DE'.</p>

        <p>S.BASIS.RATE.VAL</p>
        <p>Specifies whether validation will trap possible input errors when a rate is entered on the LD record. The rate is used as a check to help prevent errors through mis-keying the interest or commission amounts. Only applies where the calculation basis is 'S'. If this field is set to YES or left null the system will verify that the amount entered is within certain tolerance checks. If the amount is within a 1% tolerance it is accepted; over 1% but less than 5% an override will warn the user; if greater than 5% then the amount or rate were mis-keyed and the system will reject the amount (either the amount or check rate should be amended). Entering NO here will bypass these checks. This option should be used with care as mistakes can get through. It would be used where specific interest payment schedules are pre-defined that could fall foul of the validation. For interest the INTEREST.BASIS, INTEREST.RATE and TOT.INTEREST.AMT fields apply For commission COMM.CAL.METHOD, COMM.RATE and TOTAL.COMM.AMOUNT apply. The user wants to specify an interest amount of USD 100,000 on a12 month loan contract of USD 900,000 so the maturity amount will be exactly USD 1 million. A check rate of 10.95 is entered. If the interest is entered as USD 10T or USD 10M it would be rejected as it would be outside the 5% tolerance. USD 101T for this example would be over 1% and would generate an override. An entry of exactly USD100T would be OK. Any value entered is accepted </p>

        <p>SIGNIFICANT.AMT</p>
        <p>A contract will not be automatically removed from the live file, following the final maturity date, if the local equivalent of any outstanding amount is greater than this Significant Amount value. When the system transfers contracts to History after maturity according to the number of days defined in the next field, it checks to see if there are any amounts that remain outstanding, and if so, whether the local equivalent amount is greater than this Significant Amount. If the amount outstanding is greater than this Significant Amount then the contract will not be transferred to History and an entry will be created in the Exception Report. If the amount outstanding is LESS than or EQUAL to the Significant Amount then the amount outstanding will be posted to a suspense account, the contract will be written to History, and an Exception report entry will be created stating the amount. A contract must also comply with other user defined parameters, such as the DAYS POST MATURITY, prior to being transferred to the History file. Important Note: The Money Market System always has 'automatic liquidation' i.e. whenever an amount is due, the whole amount is paid/received. This means that the above mechanism should NEVER be applicable to Money Market contracts. </p>

        <p>Defines the default charge code which the system will use in appropriate transaction input routine. When loading a contract the user may specify a charge code in the relevant field. If no specific charge code is input and charges are applicable then the system will apply the default charge code contained in this field. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1 to 3 Numeric characters. (Optional input. No Default.) Input must be a valid code on the LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS table. The charge code must be one that has monthly amortisation set to "NO" on the LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS table.</p>
        <p>ACC.CYCLE.FLOAT</p>
        <p>Indicates whether interest on contracts based on floating rates, are to be accrued on a daily basis or only when a rate change occurs. This field has an effect only when accruals as specified in fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY are set to "monthly". Setting of fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY to "daily" overrides this field. If fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and ACC CYCLE F CCY are set to "monthly" frequency then, where interest on a contract is based on a floating rate (e.g. Base Rate) the user is allowed the alternative of instructing the system to calculate interest on a daily basis and pass accounting entries accordingly. Alternatively, the system may be instructed to merely inspect the interest rate on a daily basis but carry out an interest accrual only when there has actually been a rate change on a contract. The following example will clarify the significance of each of these alternatives:- Suppose that a contract runs thus:- Value Day Day Day Day Day Mat. Date 1 2 3 4 5 Date 10% 10% 10% 11% 11% 9% 9% A) Input of '1' at this field will instruct the system to carry out the interest accruals on a daily basis and pass accounting entries accordingly. This means that on day 1 the system will calculate interest at 10% on the contract for one day and pass the appropriate accounting entries. Similarly, at day 2 it will again calculate interest at 10% on the contract for one day and pass the accounting entries. At day 3 there is a rate change to 11% and the system will therefore calculate interest on the contract for one day at 11% and pass entries and so on through to maturity of the contract. B) Input of '2' at this field will instruct the system only to carry out interest accruals when there has been an actual rate change. Thus on each of days 1 and 2 the system will merely check the interest rate on the contract, find that the rate rate has remained at 10% throughout, and will not therefore carry out an interest accrual. However, at day 3 the system will check the interest rate, find that it has moved up from 10% to 11% and will then calculate interest on the contract for two days at 10% and pass the appropriate accounting entries. It will then continue to check the rate on a daily basis until it finds that at day 5 the rate fell back from 11% to 9% when it will then accrue interest on the contract for a further two days, but at 11% and again pass the appropriate accounting entries. It will continue with this procedure until contract maturity. Note: If the appropriate accrual cycle field (field ACC CYCLE L CCY or ACC CYCLE F CCY according to currency of the contract) was set to "DAILY" then the difference between method "1" and "2" above would not be apparent since accruals would always be done daily. This field only comes into effect when fields ACC CYCLE L CCY and/or ACC CYCLE F CCY are "MONTHLY". </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> 1 Numeric character. The only valid input allowed is "1" (meaning book daily irrespective of rate change) or "2" (meaning book only when there is a rate change). (Optional input. Default = "1") Input must be "1" or "2".</p>
        <p>FID.COM.CHRG.QUOTE</p>
        <p>Specifies whether default fiduciary commissions are to be calculated from the local or foreign currency records in the fiduciary commission table. The fiduciary commission charge quotation mode input at this field specifies whether default fiduciary commission amounts are to be calculated using the local currency records or the records according to the deal currency. For example a USD deal operating under the (F)oreign FID COMM CHG QUOTE mode will use the USD records in the MM.FID.COMMISSION table to obtain a default fiduciary commission. The same deal operating in a (L)ocal FID COMM CHG QUOTE mode will use the GBP records in the MM.FID.COMMISSION table and convert the amount to dollars at the mid-rate. </p>

        <p>FID.COMM.AT.MAT.Y</p>
        <p>Specifies whether or not a fiduciary commission is to be charged at the maturity or takedown of a contract. Input of Y(es) at this field means that the fiduciary commission will be charged whenever interest is paid or on maturity of the contract. Current market practice is to charge fiduciary commission at the payment of interest/maturity of a deal and, in keeping with this, the system only allows the user to charge commission at interest payment/contract maturity. </p>

        <p>The input at this field instructs the system how to continue processing during the 'off-line' when an entry would require an override. During the end of day processing the system call to accounting is replaced by a call to EOD ACCOUNTING. This ensures that there is no need for a user to be at the screen when a possible override condition is reached. The important parameter in this call, as far as the user is concerned, is the field EOD ACCT MODE which can have one of the following values:- A) SAO - (System Automatic Override) - any override condition will automatically have the answer 'YES' assigned to it. B) SSS - (System Suspense) - any override condition will automatically have the answer 'YES' assigned to it if the entry is to an internal account. An entry to a customer account will be replaced by an entry to a suspense account in the event of an override condition being encountered. </p>

Alternatively, the system may be instructed to merely inspect the interest rate on a daily basis but carry out an interest accrual only when there has actually been a rate change on a contract.</p>
            <p>The following example will clarify the significance of each of these alternatives:-</p>
            <p>Suppose that a contract runs thus:-</p>
            <p>Value    Day    Day    Day    Day    Day    Mat.    Date      1      2      3      4      5     Date</p>
            <p>10%     10%    10%    11%    11%     9%      9%</p>
            <p>A)         Input of '1' at this field will instruct the system to carry            out the interest accruals on a daily basis and pass            accounting entries accordingly. This means that on day            1 the system will calculate interest at 10% on the contract            for one day and pass the appropriate accounting entries.            Similarly, at day 2 it will again calculate interest at 10%            on the contract for one day and pass the accounting            entries. At day 3 there is a rate change to 11% and the            system will therefore calculate interest on the contract            for one day at 11% and pass entries and so on through to            maturity of the contract.</p>
            <p>B)         Input of '2' at this field will instruct the system only to            carry out interest accruals when there has been an            actual rate change. Thus on each of days 1 and 2 the            system will merely check the interest rate on the            contract, find that the rate rate has remained at 10%            throughout, and will not therefore carry out an interest            accrual. However, at day 3 the system will check the            interest rate, find that it has moved up from 10% to 11%            and will then calculate interest on the contract for two            days at 10% and pass the appropriate accounting entries.            It will then continue to check the rate on a daily basis            until it finds that at day 5 the rate fell back from 11% to            9% when it will then accrue interest on the contract for a            further two days, but at 11% and again  pass the            appropriate accounting entries. It will continue with this            procedure until contract maturity.</p>
            <p>Note:      If the appropriate accrual cycle field (field ACC CYCLE            L CCY or ACC CYCLE F CCY according to currency of            the contract) was set to "DAILY" then the difference            between method "1" and "2" above would not be apparent            since accruals would always be done daily. This field            only comes into effect when fields ACC CYCLE L CCY            and/or ACC CYCLE F CCY are "MONTHLY".</p>

            <p>This field is linked to EB.ACCRUAL.PARAM table. Interest Amount Calculation and Interest Accrual method can be chosen through appropriate record defined in EB.ACCRUAL.PARAM. For Example, First Day Accrual, Last Day Accrual or Both days Accrual. If this field is null it denotes First Day Accrual Method.</p>
            <p>This field is used as the system default for all Money Market contracts. This can be overridden at contract level.</p>

<field>BILL.CHG.CODE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the LMM.CHARGE.CONDITIONS codes used to book profit and loss from the rediscount of a Trade Bill or Bills. The LMM.CHARGE.CONDITION codes indicate the profit and loss categories used for booking the P&amp;L.</p>
            <p>Value 1 of this field specifies the Profit Charge Code (i.e a RECEIVEable code) Value 2 of this field specifies the Loss Charge Code (i.e. a PAYable code)</p>
            <p>When a trade bill or bundle of bills are rediscounted, the difference between the discount rate and the rediscount rate should be realised as profit and loss at the time of the rediscount. In order to do this the system will calculate the total profit and loss due to each of the bills being discounted, the total of profit  or loss of all bills linked to the contract will be added to the CHRG.AMNT field together with the appropriate CHRG.CODE defaulted from this field.</p>
