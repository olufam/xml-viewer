<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>Banks are often advised of details of incoming funds by other institutions or clients. This information can be sufficient enough for the bank to decide to allow a client an intra day overdraft since the funds advised could be 'guaranteed', or the bank may take a business risk and allow the payment.</p>
            <p>In order to do this the 'expected' receipt information needs to be recorded in T24 and used to provide balance projection information for ad-hoc Enquiries or reports.</p>
            <p>This module allows the user to enter the expected receipts manually; to have them created by incoming SWIFT MT210s and to match them, where possible automatically, or manually.</p>
            <p>Funds Transfers can be set to create an automatic 'receipt' record being the opposite to the 'expected' record. Where the receipt is the one 'expected' and providing the details are all correct then an automatch is made when the FT is authorised. Similar can be done for records that are within defined tolerances, others need to be matched manually.</p>
            <p>The updates are stored on fields on the ACCOUNT file and users can create information enquiries based on these fields; the expected/received records (AC.EXPECTED.RECS) or a combination of both.</p>

<field>PROCESS.AV.LIMIT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specify whether the Online Processing of available Limit for this record is required or Not.</p>
            <p>When "RC" is inputted and matched with a "EC", the Available Limit amount is increased. To utilise these available amount for any "EC" record which is in status "UAL" -Unauthorised Limit, this flag can be set to "YES". In such case any FT which is in IHLD status for this Account.Id because of Unavailable Limit, will be processed and used to the extent of available Amount.</p>
            <p>To skip available limit processing during AC.EXPECTED.RECS, set this flag to Null. During End of day batch process above limit processing will be done.</p>
