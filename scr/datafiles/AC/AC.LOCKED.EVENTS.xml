            <p />
            <p>In previous releases, blocked funds were recorded directly into the </p>
            <p>ACCOUNT</p>
            <p />application as a &amp;#8216;Locked Amount&amp;#8217; with an associated &amp;#8216;From Date&amp;#8217;.<p />There was little by way of validation of these fields. The balance of the account was checked against the total amount of locked funds, and if it fell below an override warning message generated.  <p /><p /><p>T24 has now been enhanced to give much more control over these locked amounts, with each amount being recorded as an EVENT in a new application called </p><p>AC.LOCKED.EVENTS.</p><p /><p /><p>This file will contain details of each amount to be locked for an account, with both start and end dates.</p><p />These events will be recorded on the <p>ACCOUNT</p><p />application using the existing fields <p>FROM.DATE </p>and<p> LOCKED.AMOUNT, </p>which are no longer available for direct input. The system will now build a &amp;#8216;ladder&amp;#8217; of values by date, automatically combining locked events that cover the same periods and accommodating all increases and decreases.<p />An event for zero amount will be automatically created to take effect from the date after the last locked amount ends.  <p>Dependant on the settings of the </p><p>CREDIT.CHECK </p>field affecting the account in question, the system will check either the <p>WORKING.BALANCE</p> against the highest amount locked or will check each <p>AVAILABLE.BALANCE</p> within the cash-flow period against each locked amount within the same period.  <p>Whenever the balance falls below the locked amount (in accordance with the above rules) an override is generated to warn of that fact.</p><p />Note: the override does not indicate by how much the account is short.  <p /><p /></ovdesc>

<field>LOCKED.AMOUNT</field>

            <p>If the balance of the account falls below this during the period (or is below this amount when the event is entered) then an override will be generated warning the user that the balance of the account is below the </p>
            <p>LOCKED.AMOUNT</p>

            <p> LOCKED.AMOUNT </p>
            <p>and not the actual amount that the account is below. So, for example, if you have a </p>
            <p>LOCKED.AMOUNT </p>
            <p>for 10,000.00 and if the account has a balance of 100 or 9,999.00 then the same override will be displayed</p>
