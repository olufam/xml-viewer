        <p> AC.ENTRY.PARAM </p>
        <p>This application is used to define the layout of incoming generic accounting interface files, and various parameters defining the processing of overrides and the suspensing of entries. The system will allow an ASCII file, which is either of fixed length, padded fields, or delimited by a specified character, to create accounting entries. The application will ensure that balanced, verified entries are raised in the T24 accounting system. </p>
        <p>File Layout The ACSII file may be comprised of record types, which are HEADER or TRAILER records containing control information, and DATA records containing the entry information. Each RECORD.TYPE can be identified by a specified character sequence in the record from a given position (RECORD.ID.POS) for a given length (RECORD.ID.LEN), or the nth element (RECORD.ID.POS) delimited by the delimiter (FIELD.DELIM). The value identifying the specific type may be defined (RECORD.ID) Each element to be extracted within the record will be defined by starting position within the record (DATA.START)and the number of bytes to be extracted (DATA.LEN), or as the nth element (RECORD.ID.POS)with a specified delimiter (FIELD.DELIM). Each data item may have a specified validation routine, either a standard IN2 routine, or a user written validation routine. Data is extracted to a reporting file AC.INWARD.ENTRY, the location of the data to be extracted may be defined in ENQ.FILE.LOC. Accounting Options The generic interface will ensure that entries raised are balanced and verified.</p>
        <p>The following options are provided: </p>
        <p>
            <p value="1">Entries may be balanced according to the following options: </p>
            <p value="2">Balance by currency, debit and credit, ignoring value date. </p>
            <p value="3">Balance by currency netting debit and credit entries, irrespective of value date. </p>
            <p value="4">Balance by value date and currency, debit and credit. </p>
            <p value="5">Balance by value date, currency irrespective of sign, netting debits and credits. </p>
            <p value="6">Balance per entry. </p>
        </p>
        <p>Balancing entries may be raised to either a nominated account per currency, or to an internal account of a defined category and department (CONTRA.ACCT.CATEG and ACCOUNT.OFFICER). The balancing (contra) entries will use definable debit and credit transaction codes, together with an additional narrative. In the case of P&amp;L entries, an additional option (CONTRA.PL.LOCAL) allows these entries to be treated as local currency or not when raising balancing entries. If P&amp;L entries are balanced by currency account entries, position updates will result, whereas if treated as local currency there is no currency position. Transaction codes may be supplied in the interface file, or default codes (DT.TXN.CODE &amp; CR.TXN.CODE)will be used for debits and credits. The following options will be available for handling errors and overrides: Overrides may automatically be approved The entry may be automatically suspensed when an override is encountered using the accounting suspense mechanism The entry may be suspensed to an account of specific ACCOUNT.CLASS (SUSP.CLASS.DR/CR) for the currency, and will create a Funds Transfer transaction of HLD status to allow correction of the error automatically defined (FT.TYPE).
