<field>ID</field>
<desc>
            <p> ID can be either SYSTEM or a Lead company id </p>
            <p>
<p value="1">“SYSTEM” – System level parameters</p>
<p value="1">“COMPANY.CODE” – Lead company id defines company level parameters (FIN level)</p>

        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>DEFAULT.HVT.FLAG</field>
<desc>
            <p>  Defines the default HVT value of “YES” or “NO” at system or company level. Exceptions to this default can be defined by category code range.</p>
<p>For example the default value can be set to “YES” and all accounts in the range 1000 to 1999 can have HVT set to “NO”, so that all accounts are HVT apart from customer retail accounts.</p>
<p>Validation Rules:</p>
<p>
            <p value="1">Non mandatory option field </p>
            <p value="1">Options are ‘YES’ or ‘NO’ </p>
        </p>
        <p> This field is made no inputtable if the live record already exits. And also if the new record is created for company level and system record exists already, then this field gets populated from the system record. </p>
            
        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>EXCP.CATEG.START</field>
<desc>
            <p>  Allows further definitions by category code or category code range. This will be the start category. </p> 
<p>For example all customer accounts could be defined as high volume except for a particular range of categories, (i.e. retail customer accounts, or customer savings accounts) If a category code range or a single category code is defined then all accounts in  this category code range will default to the opposite of the default value.</p> 
<p>If the default value is “YES” then these accounts will be non HVT. If the default value is “NO” then accounts defined here will default to HVT.</p>
<p>Validation Rules:</p>
<p>
            <p value="1">Should accept a valid category code</p>
            <p value="1">Category code must be in the range 1000-19999 </p>
 </p>
            <p> This field is made no inputtable if the live record already exits. And also if the new record is created for company level and system record exists already, then this field gets populated from the system record. </p>
                               
        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>EXCP.CATEG.END</field>
<desc>
            <p>  This field defines the end category of the associated category code range.</p>
            <p>Validation Rules:</p>
<p>
            <p value="1">Should accept a valid category code</p>
            <p value="1">Category code must be in the range 1000-19999 </p>
</p>
			<p> This field is made no inputtable if the live record already exits. And also if the new record is created for company level and system record exists already, then this field gets populated from the system record. </p>

<t>
<field>NON.HVT.JOB</field>
<desc>
            <p>  Defines jobs that should be run with HVT turned off for non Nostro customer accounts. When these jobs run they will override any HVT default or individual account settings and will read and update the account related tables directly. All these jobs should be written in such a way as to eliminate or minimise any locking contention on customer accounts.</p> 
<p>Validation Rules:</p>
<p>
            <p value="1">Should have a entry in PGM.FILE</p>
            <p value="1">PGM.TYPE should be ‘B’ </p>
                              
     </p>
        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>TRIG.ACTIVE.TIME</field>
<desc>
            <p>  Defines the length of time in minutes that the current AC.HVT.TRIGGER record is active. AC.HVT.TRIGGER stores consolidated account updates for a particular account for an individual online session. The active record will be the one currently updated by online T24 updates. Once a record ceases to be active it becomes available to the online HVT merge service which will update the actual account related tables. A balanced merge service should ensure that its “catch up” processing ensures that only the currently active records remain in the AC.HVT.TRIGGER table.</p>
<p>The default value is 15 minutes, a company level value will override the system level default</p>
<p>Validation Rules:</p>
<p>
            <p value="1">Should accept a value from 5-99 (Minimum interval time is 5minutes)</p>
