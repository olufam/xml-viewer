            <p>This file will be a new financial level file that must replace the old FX.TRANSACTION file. The old file FX.TRANSACTION records the forward currency position updates for FOREX deals. This new file will be updated for all applications in order to extend the flexibility of re-valuing forward positions using the forward rate table. The only change made to the file will be to its ID field as indicated below. All the rest of the fields will remain the same.</p>

<field>CURRENCY.MARKET</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies to which market the following rates apply in those countries where more than one market exists to determine the exchange rates of foreign currencies.</p>
            <p />
            <p> All Transaction Processing Applications contain a data element Currency Market and any input made in this field will be checked against this table to derive or verify the appropriate exchange rate of the transaction. The exchange rates applicable to the Market 1 will always be defaulted if no other input has been done.</p>
            <p />
            <p> For the local currency input in this FIELD will also be allowed to permit the user to use, if required, the fields Quotation Suspense and Negotiable Amount. These are the only 2 fields of the association which will be allowed for the local currency.</p>
            <p />
            <p> A typical example is Belgium where foreign currencies are quoted on the Convertible/Regular market and also on the Financial/Free market. Different sets of exchange rates will exist according to these two markets and this explains the reason and the purpose of this field.</p>
            <p />
            <p> The CURRENCY table allows you to identify, if required, up to nine different markets and consequently to define for each foreign currency up to nine different sets of exchange rates. The System will always force you to define at least one set of rates, i.e. to define the exchange rates applicable to the currency Market 1 which will be the default currency Market used by all Transaction processing applications.</p>
            <p />
            <p> It must also be noted that this CURRENCY.MARKET field can also be used within the concept of notional market, i.e. where you would like to define different sets of exchange rates according to the type of product handled. One set of exchange rates, for example, could be defined to identify the exchange rates applicable to your Notes transactions, set of rates for travellers cheques, another set of rates for your transfer transactions, etc.</p>

            <p />
            <p> For all the countries where more than one market exists for the determination of the exchange rates, input of the various markets in this field will be essential to ensure a correct definition of the exchange rates applicable to the various markets.</p>
            <p />
            <p> The Currency Market 1 will always be mandatory.</p>

            <p />
            <p> Compound Method:</p>
            <p> NPV = Deal Profit or Loss/ [(1+ r/100) to the power of n/365]</p>
            <p />
            <p>  Where ' r ' is the rate of interest from the PERIODIC.INTEREST Table and ' n ' is the number of days the value date is from the Spot Date as on run date and 365 is the basis (The basis is as applicable to the Local Currency.)</p>
            <p />
            <p> If the Value Date of the deal falls within the Spot Period for the currency pair, then no discounting is done. If the Value Date falls within one year from the Spot Date for the currency pair, discounting will be done under Simple Method. If the Value Date falls beyond one year from the Spot Date for the currency pair, discounting will be done under Compound Method.</p>
            <p> The Spot Date for the currency pair will be reckoned as on run date. The year is always calendar year.</p>
