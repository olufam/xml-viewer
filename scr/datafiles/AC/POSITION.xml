            <p>The local currency equivalent of the bought amount (AMOUNT.1). </p>
            <p> This figure is originally calculated on line when the record is first updated/created.  it will subsequently be revalued every night and reflect the current local currency equivalent position. </p>

            <p> Example: </p>
            <p> If a foreign exchange deal is entered as :- </p>
            <p>       Buy CCy            ITL       Sell CCy           JPY       Buy Amount         1,000,000       Sell Amount        5,000,000 </p>
            <p> Assume deal entered in company NG0010001, currency market 1 is used, position type is trading (TR), and value date of deal is 19930325 </p>
            <p> Then the following two position records will be raised :-  Position Id - NG00100011TR25ITLJPY19930325            AMOUNT.1      -1,000,000            AMOUNT.2      5,000,000            LCY.EQUIV     -23,000 </p>
            <p> Position Id - NG00100011TR25JPYITL19930325            AMOUNT.1      5,000,000            AMOUNT.2      -1,000,000            LCY.EQUIV     23,000 </p>
            <p> Note: All foreign exchange transfers arising from non FX applications, ie. Funds Transfer, Tellere, etc, will create four position records, one for bought currency against local, one for local against bought currency, one for sold currency against local, and one for local against sold currency.  Only Foreign Exchange deals will maintain cross currency positions, wheras all other applications will maintain positions against the local currency. </p>

            <p> Unique key identifying the position record. </p>
            <p> The POSITION ID is made up of the following structure :-            [CO][CM][PT][DD][B.CCY][S.CCY][V.DATE] Where: </p>
            <p>            CO   -   Company Code (eg NG0010001)            CM   -   Currency Market            PT   -   Position Type            DD   -   Dealer Desk            B.CCY  - Bought Currency            S.CCY  - Sold Currency            V.DATE - Value date </p>
            <p> Each time a deal or process that generates cross currency entries is entered into the system, then the above position id is made up from the transaction details, and this record will either be updated or created. </p>
