            <p>This file contains details such as outstanding interest and charges, and is used to indicate that an account is flagged for closure. </p>
            <p>  The information is provided to help the user determine the entries which must be booked to bring the Balance to zero and allow automatic closing to proceed. </p>
            <p>  The procedure for closing an Account is as follows: </p>
            <p>  (1)        Select this application, and using the input function, set the            POSTING.RESTRICT field to a value in the range 90 - 99. </p>
            <p>  (2)        The 'CAPITAL.DATE' filed holds the date on which the system            should start the closure process by capitalising outstanding            interest and charges. </p>
            <p>  (3)        The 'SETTLEMENT.ACCOUNT' field is used to enter the number of            the account to which the outstanding balance is to be            transferred. If no account number is entered the outstanding            balance must be brought to zero manually. </p>
            <p>  (4)        The outstanding interest and charges are calculated            immediately, up to the Capitalisation Date specified. (These            calculations are for information only, no accounting entries            are generated by this procedure). </p>
            <p>  (5)        The results of the interest and charges calculation, the            current balance, and indicators whether or not there are            any uncleared items, standing orders, cheques or cards            outstanding are displayed in NOINPUT fields on the record. </p>
            <p>  (6)        If a SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT is specified, an override will be            required if the sum of the balance and outstanding interest and            charges is negative. </p>
            <p>  (7)        If the SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT exists in the system, and has a            different customer to the account being closed, an override            will be required. </p>
            <p>  (8)        The POSTING.RESTRICT field in the ACCOUNT record is updated            with the information in the POSTING.RESTRICT field on this            file. </p>
            <p>  (9)        Subsequent input to this record will allow the CAPITALISATION            DATE and SETTLEMENT ACCOUNT to be changed. Interest and charges            will also be re-calculated if required. </p>
            <p>  Interest and Charges are calculated on the value dated balances and account activity statistics stored in the ACCT.ACTIVITY file, taking into account all entries over the Account up to and including the last end of day processing. </p>
            <p>  Notes: (1)        For new Accounts no charges are calculated for the month in            which the Account is loaded. </p>
            <p>  (2)        No account charges are calculated for the month in which            the Account is closed, unless the Closure Capitalisation            date is the last day of the month. </p>
            <p>  (3)        No bookkeeping entries are generated by this application.            All details contained in this file are for information            only. </p>
            <p>  (4)        The calculations do not take into account the effect of            any transactions which have not yet taken place but            which are expected to happen before the capitalisation            date specified, (e.g. Standing Orders or regular            interest capitalisation), or any transactions which have            been processed since the last 'end of day processing'. </p>
            <p />
            <p>  When an ACCOUNT is flagged for closure, any entries over the ACCOUNT require an override. </p>
            <p>  The ACCOUNT.CLOSURE.PARAM is also checked during account closure and provides overrides if any based on the parameters set. </p>
            <p>  During the end of day processing on the Closure Capitalisation date specified, or, if this is a non-working day, on the previous working day, the outstanding interest and charges are recalculated and capitalised. </p>
            <p>  During the start of day processing after the interest and charges capitalisation, a funds transfer will be generated between the Account and Settlement account if specified, to automatically bring the account balance to zero. </p>
            <p>  If the settlement account exists within the system an AC type funds transfer will be generated. Debit balances can be transferred by this type of transaction. The settlement account need not have the same currency as the account. </p>
            <p>  If the settlement account does not exist in the system, a BC type funds transfer will be generated. Only local currency accounts with credit balances will successfully generate these transactions. </p>
            <p>  The funds transfer will be automatically authorised on successful validation, otherwise it will be put on HLD status. </p>
            <p>  During end of day processing the following working day, if the ACTUAL and CLEARED BALANCE are both zero, the ACCOUNT is closed. </p>
            <p>  If either BALANCE is not zero, the ACCOUNT remains open and interest capitalisations are processed during every end of day run until it can be closed. </p>
            <p>  When the ACCOUNT is closed, it is removed from the live ACCOUNT file and written in the Account History file (ACCOUNT$HIS) with a RECORD STATUS of 'CLOSED', a closing account statement is produced and any remaining Standing Orders are cancelled. </p>

            <p>  1. If CLOSE.MODE is FT, the system creates the FT in HOLD and the user has to autorise the FT and made the account balance as zero and then move the account to history by authorising ACCOUNT CLOSURE manually.</p>
            <p>  2. If CLOSED.MODE is TELLER the system creates the TELLER.DEFAULT and the user has to make the a/c bal zero through TELLER and then move the account to history by autorising the ACCOUNT CLOSURE manually. </p>
            <p>  If the record is subsequently deleted, then the earlier updation in Account application will be restored back to NULL.</p>
            <p>  If the SETTLEMENT.ACCOUNT is supplied, then, at the time of authorization of ACCOUNT.CLOSURE Record, then the final settlement will take place between the account that is to be closed and the SETTLEMENT.ACCOUNT.  </p>
            <p>  If the SETTLEMENT.ACCOUNT is not supplied, then a TELLER.DEFAULT record will be created and with this TELLER has to be created by USER. </p>
            <p>  In both the cases above, the interest and charges will be posted to PL online during authorization of ACCOUNT.CLOSURE.  </p>
            <p>  3. If the CLOSE.MODE is Payment, system creates a Payment Order record. If the closure is online, the PO record is created with IHLD status- otherwise, PO record is generated during the COB.</p>
            <p> Both Account transfer type and Beneficiary Transfer Type Payment orders are allowed.</p>             
            <p> If PAYMENT option is selected as close mode and if the PI module is not installed in the system, a FT is created instead of a PO transaction</p>
