                <p> Some applications may raise forward entries with a value date, but no processing may occur on the value date. For example a Fiduciary order, a security order or a Past Due record. It is important for these application to leave the entry as the impact on the cash-flow is required for the account. In these cases the value of this field should be set to Y, which will cause the date to cyled every night instead of being removed.</p>
                <p> Other applications such as LD, Swaps and Bond Processing in securities, allow adjustment of the value date on non-working days, so that it is possible to get a back dated entry for an event to be processed in the future. For these situations thisi field can contain the date on which the event is to be processed, amd therefore the date the forward entry expires. The system will cycle such entries forward when the value date is less than the system date until the expiry date is reached.</p>
