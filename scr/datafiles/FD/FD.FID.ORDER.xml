            <p>This application is used by account officers to record details of Fiduciary deposits on behalf of customers of the bank. The account officer will enter the details of the customer requesting the deposit, and the details of the deposit required. </p>
            <p>Two different types of Fiduciary deposit may be requested: </p>
            <p>FIXED  term deposits where the funds are deposited for a pre-determined        length of time with afixed maturity date, and </p>
            <p>NOTICE deposits where funds are deposited for an unspecified length        of time, but with a period of notice that must be given prior        to reimbursement of funds. </p>
            <p>The principal deposited for FIXED contracts cannot be changed during the life of the contract, and the depositor will receive a fixed rate of interest. The principal deposited for NOTICE contracts can be increased and decreased during the life of the contract, and the interest rate can be variable. </p>
            <p>Once authorised, the Orders taken by the account officer will be given to the dealer to place with another bank. Contracts will be 'pooled' automatically by matching orders with the same currency, value and maturity dates to form a single deposit to be placed by the dealer. The automatic pooling of orders can be overridden if requested by the account officer, or if the customer has specific requirements for the placement of funds. </p>
            <p>Once an order is accepted by the dealer, the amount, currency, value and maturity dates cannot be amended by the account officer. Requests for principal increase/decrease, and contract reimbursement on NOTICE contracts must be approved by the dealer after entry by the account officer. </p>
            <p>Interest is paid at the maturity date of Fiduciary deposits, and additionally at specified settlement dates on NOTICE contracts. The rate and frequency of interest payment is determined by the bank that the Funds are placed with. </p>
            <p>A commission can be taken in ADVANCE at the start of the deposit, or in ARREARS, at maturity, and each principal movement and interest settlement. Optional charges can also be taken at the start of the contract. Customers will usually sign a mandate stating that the Withholding tax will not be deducted from the amount of interest earn, however if no mandate is held, the withholding tax can be deducted from the customer at interest settlement if required. </p>
            <p>Customers can automatically renew FIXED fiduciary deposits after the maturity of the original deposit. The renewed deposit can be for the same amount of principal, or the principal plus interest earn (less commission if taken at maturity). The renewed deposit will be generated a pre-determined number of days before the maturity of the current deposit. </p>
            <p />
            <p>POOLING OF ORDERS ================= FIXED orders will be pooled whenever possible. Orders are matched by Currency, Value Date and Maturity Date to form a pool group. Pool groups can be split into separate groups if required. The dealer must approve each order in a group before the Fiduciary placement contract is automatically created based on the total amount of the pool group. Once the first order in a group has been approved, any new orders entered will be assigned a new group. </p>
            <p>For NOTICE contracts, where it is possible to pool orders to an existing placement (as defined on FD.PARAMETER), the pool group for existing placements will be checked first. An order will match the existing placement group if the currency and number of days notice match and the value date of the order is greater than or equal to the value date of the placement, and the order is NOT back valued. </p>
            <p>Once an order is authorised, a pooling group number will be assigned. The contract will be checked against existing FD.POOL.GROUP records to find a match, if automatic pooling is required for the order. If no match is found, or the order is not to be pooled, a new group number will be assigned. </p>
            <p>If a customer has specified banks where funds are NOT to be placed, or alternatively preferred banks for the placement, the order will not be automatically pooled, but can be included in a specific group by the dealer if requested. Any special conditions relating to an order, entered in the dealer instructions field, will also prevent an order from being automatically pooled. Details of preferred and excluded banks for the placement of funds are held on the file FD.CUST.DETAILS. </p>
            <p>The dealer may wish to split the principal of one order into several smaller orders of the same total amount. The dealer may split the order to spread the customer's exposure over several fiduciary banks, or adjust the amount for the placement. Once an order is split, the original order is not processed, and is replaced by the appropriate number of split orders. </p>
            <p>If an error is made in the entry of the order, this can be corrected if the order has not been approved by the dealer. If an order has been approved but not yet placed by the dealer, the approval can be cancelled, the correction made, and the order can then be re-approved. Once the placement has been made by the dealer, amendment of the details of principal, currency, value date and maturity date can only be made by reversing the FD.FIDUCIARY (placement) contract which will then allow all orders linked to the placement to be amended. In this case all orders in will be re-pooled, and must be approved by the dealer again. </p>
            <p>An order which has been pooled, may be replaced by a new order with the same financial details (i.e. amount, currency, value and maturity dates).  This may be required when the customer details originally entered are incorrect. Orders can be replaced any time up to maturity, or the first interest payment or principal change. Any accounting entries already made (i.e. at drawdown), will be reversed for the old order, and regenerated for the replacement. The old order will then be reversed. All processing for the replacement takes place during the end of day. </p>
            <p />
            <p>FIDUCIARY COMMISSION ==================== Fiduciary commission can be taken at the start or end of a deposit, and at principal and interest movements on Notice contracts if required. The type and calculation of commission is determined by parameters defined at the customer level. Each customer has a CUSTOMER.CHARGE record, which indicates which FD.GROUP.CONDITION applies to the customer. The FD.GROUP.CONDITION record defines which FD.COMMISSION.TYPE record will be used to derive the amount of commission applicable. </p>
            <p>Different commission types can be specified for each category of deposit. If no details are defined for the particular category of a deposit, the  details for the order type will be taken. Together with the type, a maximum and minimum commission amount, and a percentage of the calculated amount to be taken can also be defined. </p>
            <p>The FD.CHARGE.PARAMETER fiel specifies whether commissions are taken in Advance, or in Arrears, whether the commission is to be calculated based on the principal, interest or income (principal plus interest) of the deposit. This file also specifies whether commission is calculated or not on principal movements and interest settlements for Notice contracts.  The minimum commission amount may only apply for principal or interest movements, and this is also specified. </p>
            <p>The commission type, commission calculation basis, and when the commission is to be taken will be defaulted, but can be overridden by the account officer. The commission amount is calculated using the following formula: </p>
            <p>Commission = Base Amt * Comm Rate * No Days              ------------------------------                    Day in year * 100 </p>
            <p>If commission is taken in arrears for Fixed contracts, the commission amount will be accrued throughout the life of the contract. </p>
            <p>Principal movements during the commission period will be taken into account when calculating the commission. The base amount used is a weighted average of the principal over the commission period. </p>
            <p />
            <p>ORDER RENEWALS ============== Orders can be renewed automatically on maturity of an existing Fixed deposit. A new order will be generated a number of days specified on FD.PARAMETER before the maturity of the existing contract. The new contract can be created either fully authorised, unauthorised, or with hold status. </p>
            <p>The principal of the renewed order can be either the principal of the existing deposit, or the principal plus interest (less commission if taken at maturity). The amount can be rounded to the nearest lower multiple of the currency as defined on FD.FID.CURRENCY. </p>
            <p>A report of new renewals for attention of the account officer will be produced by the end of day process. </p>
            <p />
            <p>ACCOUNTING ========== All accounting entries are passed on the appropriate value date. It is important to note that no entries will be passed until the placement contract has been authorised. The customer cash flow will be updated on entry of the order. Cash flow will also be updated for the next principal,interest, commission and charges movement. </p>
            <p>Accounting entries are raised at end of day for all order events apart from reversal. </p>
            <p />
            <p>DELIVERY ======== Customer advices are generated for the following activities: </p>
            <p>         - New deposit (only when placed)          - Initiation of deposit (value date)          - Maturity          - Principal increase/decrease (Notice only)          - Intermediate interest payment (Notice only)          - Change of interest rate (Notice only)          - Amendment of commission or settlement details          - Contract reversal </p>
            <p>The format and type of message produced by the above events is determined by the FD.ADVICES and FD.ACTIVITY applications. </p>
