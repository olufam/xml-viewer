            <p>This application allows rules for calculating commission on fiduciary deposits to be defined. </p>
            <p>Fiduciary commission can be calculated as a flat amount, or on a level or banded basis. The commission levels and bands, and flat amounts can be specified in any valid currency, but must  always be defined in the local currency. </p>
            <p>The application is used to define the transaction code to be used for debiting the customer and crediting the bank (Profit and Loss). The category to be credited is defined on the FD.PARAMETER record, and is the same as the category for the accrued fixed commission. </p>
            <p>Commission is calculated using the following formula: </p>
            <p>           Comm = Base Amt * Comm Rate * No Days                   ------------------------------                         Days in Year * 100 where: </p>
            <p>Base Amt       is the amount on which the calculation is based. This may                be the Principal, Interest or Income (Principal plus                Interest) of the order. In the case of principal the                principal used is a weighted average of the principal over                the commission period. </p>
            <p>Comm Rate      is the rate defined in the FD.COMMISSION.TYPE table.  This                may be determined in relation to the base amount by a                banded or level method. </p>
            <p>No Days        is the number of days in the commission period, determined                according to the interest day basis of the order.  Days in                Year is the number of days in the year accoding to the                interest day basis of the order. </p>
            <p>Days in Year   is the number of days in the year according to the interest                day basis of the order. </p>

            <p>    If Flat is specified, the basic Flat Amount will be applied. </p>
