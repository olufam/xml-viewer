        <p> EB OFS.SOURCE 
</p>
        <p>GENERIC.USER</p>
        <p>
Identifies the T24 USER @ID used by the OFS.ONLINE.MANAGER phantom process. When T24 SMS checking is required, specified by IB.USER.CHECK, this user will provide the SMS profile for all transactions. If the SERVICE.TYPE is TELNET then the T24 USER must have security access to EB.PHANTOM.PH as defined in the user's APPLICATION field. 

</p>
        <b>Validation Rules</b>
        <p> Mandatory input when SERVICE.TYPE is TELNET Must be a valid T24 USER @ID. Mandatory if IB.USER.CHECK is set to Y
</p>
        <p>IB.USER.CHECK</p>
        <p>
Specifies whether each transaction supplied to T24 using this service requires the sign on name and password to be validated for external users. For external users the sign on name and passwords are controlled using the T24 applications IB.USER and IB.USER.PASSWORD. These applications allow specification of the individual sign on name and password, the associated CUSTOMER , ACCOUNT and PORTFOLIO numbers accessible to that external user, and the required language and amount formatting options for the user. When external users are defined a generic user profile is required to provide the overall security profile and link to SMS. If this field is defined as Y a GENERIC.USER must be specified. When this field is null or N, SMS checks the USER record for security profile. When field is Y - SMS checks the IB.USER record for security profile. The external user sign on name and password must be supplied with every OFS transaction / enquiry request to allow it to be processed successfully.

Typically such a routine could be used to populate the input directory with OFS messages derived from a third party source. Routine Details Arguments : None Note at the point this routine is called the T24 common variables are available. The following common areas should be included in the routine I_EQUATES, I_COMMON and I_GTS.COMMON. The I_GTS.COMMON contains the following OFS information OFS$LOG.FILE.NAME Log file used for OFS processing OFS$SOURCE.ID ID of the OFS source record OFS$SOURCE.REC Parameter file read from OFS.SOURCE

The UNIX or NT pathname for the directory can be specified with '/' separators (Note do not use '\' in an NT environment). If no path is specified the system will create a directory at authorisation if it does not exist, otherwise the directory must exist. A Batch OFS service can operate using either a specific record within the directory specified here, defined in IN.QUEUE.NAME, or can process any file within the directory if no specific name is specified. Each file may contain one or more records in specified OFS message format. Processed records are written to the directory specified in the OUT.QUEUE.DIR either to the specified OUT.QUEUE.NAME or the same name as the inward record. The batch interface will support both OFS and GTS format messages. 

</p>
        <b>Validation Rules</b>

A Batch OFS service can operate using either a specific record within the directory specified here, defined in IN.QUEUE.NAME, or can process any file within the directory if no specific name is specified. Each file may contain one or more records in specified OFS or GTS message format. Processed records are written to the directory specified in the OUT.QUEUE.DIR either to the specified OUT.QUEUE.NAME or the same name as the inward record.

Defines the name of the directory used to store the log files created when running OFS. The UNIX or NT pathname for the directory can be specified with '/' separators (Note do not use '\' in an NT environment). If no path is specified the system will create a directory at authorisation if it does not exist, otherwise the directory must exist.

The directory name here can be specified as a full Unix or NT path, note that in an NT environment the path should be specified using '/' characters instead of '\'. If no path is specified then the directory will be created automatically by the system at authorisation, otherwise the directory must already exist. The directory name is required if message logging is required. For example, a log file directory maintained in the "EB" directory of the data account could be defined as: ../bnk.data/eb/ofslog Each on-line communciation process will maintain a separate log file within the directory, the key to the log file will be the EB.PHANTOM key used to monitor the process.

</p>
        <p>LOGIN.ID</p>
        <p>
Specifies the UNIX or NT login that will automatically initiate the communication with the external source. The external source will initiate communications by issuing a login using the specified id. The system will automatically begin the communication process when this login is detected. Automatic processes initiated at login are stored in the EB.AUTO.PROCESS application. This table is updated automatically based on the values stored in this field. The status of automatic processes is monitored using the EB.PHANTOM application and enquiry EP.MONITOR. A specific EB.PHANTOM.ID can be allocated if required using the associated EB.PHANT.ID field. Unix machines can have mixed case alphanumeric Login id's so the if the id is

Each OFS on-line session is a single UniVerse user, so the number specified here must be less than the maximum number of users (defined in SPF - NO.OF.USERS). When a new on-line session is started the system will create a new connection is required providing the maximum number of connections defined here has not been exceeded.

If this field is set to Y the system will maintain a store and forward queue when transactions are submitted whilst the system is offline. Transactions can be processed when the system is back on-line by running an EB.PHANTOM process using the RUN.ROUTINE OFS.QUEUE.MANAGER. Details of transactions are held in the OFS.REQUEST.DETAIL application, each message will be allocated a standard T24 format id (XXXXjjjjjnnnnn) with a prefix defined in the DET.PREFIX field.

</p>
        <p>SOURCE.TYPE</p>
        <p>
Defines the type of communication used to exchange data with this service. OFS allows communication through a BATCH process where a directory is populated with records in either a particular file, or several files. When combined with the OO module, single messages may be passed to T24 through a TELNET connection. Records can be created in a T24 program or sub-routine using the T24 setting, whilst the new T24 broswer uses the SESSION option. BATCH A Batch connection will usually run as a background Phantom task initiated by the EB.PHANTOM application. This will examine a specified directory (the IN.QUEUE.FILE), either checking for a specific file (IN.QUEUE.NAME) or checking the entire directory for files to process. Each file may contain multiple records. The processed records will be written to the out directory (OUT.QUEUE.FILE), either to a specific file (OUT.QUEUE.NAME) or a file with the same name as the inward file. The batch connection will support GTS syntax messages or OFS syntax messages. TELNET The Telnet connection allows for messages to be passed using a simple communication mechanism. Each message sent to OFS will be processed, the results will be returned to the external source. The Telnet communication will be initiated automatically when the external source initiates a login using a specific id, defined in the field LOGIN.ID. The telnet connection will only accept OFS syntax messages and is only available when module OO is installed. T24 This is used when calls to OFS.T24.MANAGER are set up in the T24 programs or user subroutines. SESSION Used for new T24 browser

The record specified does not need to exist, it will be created when the communication begins. If no record is specified the system will allocate a record id automatically based on the SOURCE.NAME - connection number. The EB.PHANTOM record will show the following information when the communication process is in progress: RUN.MODE - OFS STATUS - ACTIVE set to CLOSED at end of communication RUN.STATUS - Source Id Session started Date Time RECEIVED date and time of last received msg REC MSG = extract of last received message TOTAL MSG REC = Total number of messages received SENT date and time of last message sent SENT MSG = extract of last sent message TOTAL MSG SENT = extract of last message sent
