            <p>The MF.EXECUTE.ORDERS application would be used to execute orders placed using MF.ORDER.</p>
            <p> This is a workfile and needs to be run in the 'V'erify mode.</p>
            <p> It is possible to select the specific orders to be executed. It is possible to restrict processing of orders to:</p>
            <p> a. A particular order by specifying the Order ID in ORDER.ID field.</p>
            <p> b. A particular fund by specifying the ID of the Fund in the FUND.ID field.</p>
            <p> c. A particular customer or a participation account by specifying the Customer ID or the Participation Account ID in the CUSTOMER.ID field or the PARTICIPATION.ACC field.</p>
            <p> d. All orders pertaining to customers of a specific Account Officer in ACCOUNT.OFFICER field</p>
            <p> e. Orders with specific transaction type. A specific TRANS.TYPE or ALL.DEBIT or ALL.CREDIT could be specified here.</p>
            <p> f.  Orders with specific order type. MARKET or PRICE orders.</p>
            <p> g. Orders placed between two dates.</p>
            <p> Once the record is verified, all the orders matching the selection criteria specified above (if multiple conditions are specified, all conditions have to be met for the order to be selected) and with DEAL.STATUS set to EXECUTE would be processed. The trade details would be updated in the order. MF.TRADE records would be created with all the required details from the order. The status of the Trade (whether created in IHLD or INAU status) would be based on TRADE.STATUS field in the application.All relevant charges would be populated in the trades created in INAU status. The process for creation of trades would be performed by a T24 service running in the background.</p>
