            <p>MF.TRADE application handles trade processing.This would be the last stage in the Order completion process.</p>
            <p>   In this application, the trade is completed, all charges are calculated and posted, customer accounts and other control accounts are debited or credited (as the case may be) and various positions – customer holdings file, security trans records etc. are updated.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  The records in MF.TRADE would automatically be created when the orders are executed. The system would populate the trade automatically with information provided in MF.ORDER and also calculate charges based on the information provided and price of execution. The back office user would only have to verify the details populated and provide additional details as may be required in the trade. Once this is done, the record could be committed and all the accounting and position updates would be done by the system.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  The records in MF.TRADE could also be created manually. In this case, there would be no orders and all mandatory details need to be provided by the user. This would be useful for cases where the order has already been executed but the details are being recorded in the system only now.</p>
