            <p>MF.ORDER application handles order processing.The records in this application could be created directly by manual input or from the pre-order application MF.ORDER.BY.CUST. The nature of information that would be recorded in this application would be similar to MF.ORDER.BY.CUST.The difference being that MF.ORDER can only handle subscriptions / redemptions to a single fund.The bulk orders, switches and plans could be recorded only in the application MF.ORDER.BY.CUST.</p>

            <p>   This would default from MF.FUND.MASTER but would be allowed to be changed in the order.</p>
            <p>   The trade would be automatically created from the order if historical is specified.</p>

<field>FEE.INCLUSIVE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Field to specify whether the order amount is inclusive or exclusive of all charges. This is valid only for cases where the order is in terms of amount (all subscriptions and few redemptions). If the FEE.INCLUSIVE is set to YES, the amount that the customer is willing to expend including all charges is the amount specified in ORDER.AMOUNT field. The order amount in that case would be adjusted for the charges and the unit calculation would be adjusted in such a way that the total settlement amount for the customer does not exceed the order amount. It must be noted that this calculation (fee calculation) would be based on current NAV prevailing in the system at this price. If the unit allocation has to be based on future NAV, then there could be some variation and the amount of settlement could be less than or more than the order amount specified.</p>
            <p>   This should be set to 'YES' if PAYMENT.MODE is not Account.</p>
