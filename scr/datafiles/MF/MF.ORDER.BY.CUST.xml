            <p>The agent, front office or branch operations of Mutual Fund companies would receive applications for subscriptions, redemptions and fund switching. Subscriptions are performed when a customer decides to invest into a fund. Redemptions are performed when the customer wishes to sell some holdings. MF.ORDER.BY.CUST  is a Pre-Order application which is used for introducing new subscribers to the fund and also handle subscription or redemption requests of existing clients. It will perform four functions: -</p>
            <p>       1. It will record details of customer order like the Fund ID, amount proposed to be invested or redeemed, payment mode (cheque, cash, switch, account debit, etc.), special order instructions like order type, expiry date, etc.</p>
            <p>       2. Handle bulk subscription/redemption requests</p>
            <p>       3. Record the details of plans that the customer would like to enter into – Systematic Investment Plans (SIP), Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) or the Systematic Switching Plans (SSP).</p>
            <p>       4. Handle Fund Switches – Switch from one fund to other</p>
