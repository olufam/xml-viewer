            <p>The BR.PRODUCT application is used as part ot the Branch Resilience module.  In conjunction with the BR.PARAMETER file it allows the user to exclude files from the build process of the branch database files. In BR.PARAMETER the individual files can be specified, but to exclude an entire product and its files would mean a complex list. The BR.PRODUCT record SYSTEM allows the user to specify which products are not required at the branch and the files that can be safely excluded.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   It is not possible for the user to exclude mandatory products, such as EB, as these are essential for even a minimalistic T24 database.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   Excluding a product should only be done if the files are not needed for normal operation. This is dependent on how the bank uses certain optional products. For example CUSTOMER.CHARGE can set groups based on the FD, FT, LC &amp; SC modules.</p>

            <p>The product(s) which are to be excluded from the database build.  Any product listed here will be used to exclude all the files owned by the product(s) from being included when the BR.CREATE.DATABASE service is run.</p>
            <p />
            <p> Some products are mandatory in a T24 database and cannot therefore be excluded and therefore will be rejected if entered here.</p>
