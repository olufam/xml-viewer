            <p>OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATION/REPORTING - REPORT NAMES </p>
            <p>This file allows grouping of different consolidation conditions under a common mnemonic name. The purpose is to provide a "short cut" for definition of reporting line contents which are repetitive within one or among several reports. The ID is a mnemonic to which one or more report line definitions (RE.STAT.REP.LINE) can refer to. </p>
            <p>The key structure, as defined in the file CONSOLIDATE.COND is the basis for the grouping and the field names will be moved in order to form the set of conditions. </p>

<field>CONSOL.NAME</field>
<desc>
            <p>This is the name (ID) by which the consolidation details grouping can be identified. </p>
            <p>The consolidation group defined herein can be used in the report line definition file. The setting up of such groups is recommended for similar line contents in a number of reports. </p>

            <p>Fields 6.1 to 17.1 contain the possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite total consolidation key permissible in T24. They specify the conditions to be satisfied for reporting against this line. The "prompts" (or components) are moved by the system from the consolidation conditions record ASSET&amp;LIAB (Field 1.1. NAME).</p>
            <p>The format code and length is obtained from the original program using file name and field number as specified on the consolidation conditions record. These fields will be part of the first set of multivalue associated fields. The possible maximum of twelve variable fields as part of the composite consolidation key is in addition to the four standard, fixed components as defined in Fields 2.1 to 5.1 above.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example: When loading details about the consolidation records to be included in a line, (Fields 3.1 - 18.1), it is not necessary to enter a value in each field. A null value means that any value for that actual field is allowed.</p>
            <p>Each consolidation record and type is matched against the line details loaded, to determine in which line(s) the CRF details are to be included. This match is done by a priority basis. The priority basis is:- Variable 1, Variable 2, Variable 3, Variable 4, Variable 5, Variable 6, Variable 7, Variable 8, Variable 9, Variable 10, Variable 11, Variable 12, Type, Currency, Position Type, Currency Market, Applic. ID.</p>
            <p>For purpose of this example assume Variable 1 is Category Code, Variable 2 is sector Code, and Variable 3-12 inclusive are not used.</p>
