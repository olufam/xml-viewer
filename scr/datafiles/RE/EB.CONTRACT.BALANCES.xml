            <p>The EB.CONTRACT.BALANCES file records the information held  in the CENTRAL.REPORTING FILE '(CRF)' down at contract level.</p>
            <p>        Account balances, principal outstanding amounts in product files and any related amount fields such as interest reserves, accrued charges, commissions, etc. held for each contract may be viewed into records held on the EB.CONTRACT.BALANCES. </p>
            <p>        The Key to the balances file is either the contract itself or the contract and an additional element. The data in the record relates to a single consol key and therefore currency.</p>
            <p />
            <p>        The purpose of this file is to : </p>
            <p>        1. Allow the user to see the online effect of a transaction to the CRF</p>
            <p>        2. provide drill down information from a reporting line </p>
            <p>        3. be used as the basis for the CRB rebuild </p>
            <p>        4. be used as the basis for CRB static changes. </p>
            <p />
            <p>        Both current and historical  details are maintained providing a means by which the system can control and record all financial transactions. </p>
            <p>        This file also provides a valuable source of information for enquiry and reporting purposes for both bank and customer requirements. </p>
            <p>        The file is updated automatically by any transaction (either online or during the close of business) that modifies CRB balance details. There is no facility for direct input to this file. The only functions that users are allowed to perform are "L"ist, "S"ee, and "P"rint. </p>
            <p>        The information is held on this file includes:</p>
            <p>        o  Currency of the balance </p>
            <p>        o  Multi-valued set of fields detailing CRB asset types and associated value date, </p>
            <p>                        maturity date, and amount of outstanding CRB balance. </p>
            <p>        o  Consol key. </p>
