            <p>The CRF reporting module allows the output of details to a sequential disk file as well as, or in place of, the standard printed output. </p>
            <p>The content and layout of records on this file can be specified by RE STAT OUTPUT. </p>
            <p>CRF report output is re-directed to a disk file by specifying the name of a record belonging to RE STAT OUTPUT in field 5 (OUTPUT MODE) on the CRF report request file (RE STAT REQUEST). </p>
            <p>Printed reports and extract files may share the same basic report definition (ie. that on the files RE STAT REPORT HEAD, RE STAT REP LINE etc). The RE STAT OUTPUT record defines the structure of data extracted from the basic report in terms of: </p>
            <p>-         the type of report lines to be extracted, and, per type           of line, </p>
            <p>-         the data content to be extracted and its position within           the ouput record. </p>
            <p>The types of report line available for printing or data extraction are: </p>
            <p>-         'HEADING' lines, which describe the contents of their           following </p>
            <p>-         'DETAIL' or 'LINK' lines, in which line details and           amounts are printed, and </p>
            <p>-         'TOTAL' lines which are used to print running totals,           sub-totals or grand totals of the preceding lines. </p>
            <p>Each occurence of a LINE TYPE on the output format record corresponds to a seperate record or line on the output file. </p>
            <p>Within each occurence of a line type, the associated sub-valued fields are used to specify the content of the sequential record and its format. </p>
            <p>The output defined by a record on this file is written to a sequential file under the directory RE CRF EXTRACT, with a key of (a) report name, (b) RE STAT OUTPUT record id and (c) date stamp (the three elements seperated by full-stops). </p>

<field>TOTAL.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>The total accumulator for which output is required. </p>
            <p>Identifies which total or sub-total field from the report is required as output. </p>
            <p>The CRF report definition permits the relationships between various running totals, sub-totals and grand totals to be defined. </p>
            <p>The value in this field corresponds to the value in field 3 (TOTAL PRINT) on the file F.RE.STAT.REP.LINE and identifies to which of the report totals the output record relates. </p>
            <p>In other words, when LINE TYPE is 'TOTAL', only those total lines for which field 3 (TOTAL PRINT) is the same as the value in this field are processed. </p>
            <p>If no input is made, the default value of 1 is taken. </p>

            <p>For each part of the output record for a line, the content is derived from the the source identified in this field. </p>
            <p>Multiple sources may be defined. The content of an output record may be any mixture of text, column (ie. amount) details or fields extracted from the report header or line record. </p>

<desc>
            <p>This field is used to separate data values in the output record. </p>
            <p>If the user wants the output data separated by a specific character, (typically this would be done if the user wants to load this data into a spreadsheet using the HOST.TO.DOS application), then this is where that value should be entered. Non printable ASCII characters may be input using their three digit ASCII ordinal value (e.g 000=NULL, 009 = TAB etc.) printable characters may be entered literally. </p>

<field>LINE.TYPE</field>

            <p>The report line type for which output is to be processed. </p>
            <p>Identifies the type of line for which an output record is to be generated. </p>
            <p>More than one type of line, per report, may be specified. For example, total lines may be output as well as detail lines. </p>
            <p>A single output record is generated for each occurence, on the report, of a line whose type is specified in this field. </p>
            <p>The lines are processed in the same sequence as they occur according to the report definition. </p>
            <p>Different contents may be specified for each type of line in the subvalues fields 4 to 6 (ITEM SOURCE to FORMAT). </p>
            <p>Furthermore, the same line type may be specified in this field more than once, in which case more than one output record is generated for the line. </p>
            <p>For example, the type 'DETAIL' may be specified once for each column of the report for which output is required. In this case, a seperate output record is generated for each column belonging to the line, with its own content definition. </p>
            <p>Multivalued field in association with fields 3 to 6. </p>
