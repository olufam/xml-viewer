            <p>This file contains the characteristics of a column. They are described in a (generic) way in order to allow usage of the column type in any report. </p>
            <p>The main definitions entered are a name (ID), the headings for printing and specific classifications into 'Balance' or 'Movement' types and content with regard to currencies or currency equivalents. </p>
            <p>The report column type definitions are used (linked to) in the definition of the report headings (titles). Refer to file RE.STAT.REPORT.HEAD. </p>
