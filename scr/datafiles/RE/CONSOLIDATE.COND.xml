            <p>The financial reporting in T24 will use, whenever possible, a single base as source for report generation. This base is called the CENTRAL.REPORTING FILE '(CRF)'.</p>
            <p>Account balances, principal outstanding amounts in product files and any related amount fields such as interest reserves, accrued charges, commissions, etc. held in each individual product record will be consolidated into records held on the 'CRF'. These records will be organised by source application to limit regeneration (if required and based on change in consolidation parameters) to a single or all applications.</p>
            <p>The 'CRF' will be maintained (rather than regenerated) by updating with details of movements from each application. These movements will cover new and maturing deals, movement from Forward to Spot to Live, changes in static data. When these movements are not covered by a STATEMENT or CATEG entry record, then a SPECIAL consolidation entry is written out.</p>
            <p>The consolidation records will, in addition to the consolidation key, hold a series of balance, total debit movement and total credit movement fields. The local currency equivalents are also held at the consolidation record level and will be revalued within the Asset and Liability revaluation process.</p>
            <p>The details are held on two files, one for Asset and Liability and another for Profit and Loss details. This is to allow for a different key structure for the two files.</p>
            <p>The Asset and Liability consolidation file key will be made up of four compulsory parameters and up to twelve additional parameters. The four compulsory parameters are:</p>
            <p>- System ID e.g. AC, FX, LD, MM, BD - Currency Market - Position Type - Currency</p>
            <p>The Profit and Loss consolidation file key will be made up of one compulsory parameter and up to twelve additional parameters. The compulsory parameter is:</p>
            <p>System ID = PL</p>
            <p>The file CONSOLIDATE.COND contains the details of the additional (up to twelve) variable fields to be used in the key for the consolidation records. There are  two default CONSOLIDATE.COND records, one which contains the details for the Asset and Liability consolidation file while the other contains the details for the Profit and Loss consolidation file. If it is required to redefine any variable for a  Company, it is possible to have Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records for both types of consolidation. The keys for default records would be ASSET&amp;LIAB, PROFIT&amp;LOSS and for COMPANY with ID </p>
            <p>xxxxxxxxx, records with keys ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx and PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx could be defined.  </p>
            <p>The additional parameters can originate from a general file (presently limited to CUSTOMER) and/or from individual system's own files. Any combination (composition) of general and specific file parameters is allowed.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to combine parameters into groups by defining a number of specific values or a range to constitute a group (e.g. Industry Codes 1001 to 1500 become "Financial Institutions").</p>
            <p>For Profit &amp; Loss details it is possible to link to the Asset &amp; Liability key and use any component from the A&amp;L key as part of the Profit &amp; Loss key.</p>
            <p>The composition of a key can be redefined at any time. During the end of day process, the consolidation base will need to be regenerated by requesting the running of the appropriate batch process. In this case it might be necessary to also change the report line definitions in order to have the new key structure reflected in the report(s).</p>
            <p>The consolidation key, at initial load or when the fields that feed the key are changed or at the regeneration of consolidation records in the CRF, will be written to the source product record. This allows efficient raising of consolidation movement entries in the daily consolidation process.</p>
            <p>When  Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND records are defined, then the keys of Asset and Liability  and  Profit and Loss consolidation files  would have two components for each variable parameter which is redefined in the Company specific consolidation record. The two components would be separated by '_'; the first component would be determined using  default definition of CONSOLIDATE.COND records  and the second component  for redefined variables would be determined using the Company specific definition of CONSOLIDATE.COND records. If a variable parameter is not redefined for a Company, then that variable in the consolidation file keys  would have only one value with no '_' suffixed. </p>
            <p>While inputting values in a Company specific CONSOLIDATE.COND record,  various validations depending on the corresponding parameter in the default record is done. However, if a parameter definition in a default CONSOLIDATE.COND record  is modified, such modification would not be automatically reflected in a Company specific record, if any. It should be ensured  that the corresponding Company specific record is also suitably modified. For example, in the default CONSOLIDATE.COND record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB", the field SECTOR is defined as the seventh multi-value and the field SECTOR is redefined in the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.US0010001". If a modification is done to the default record such that the field SECTOR is now  the eight multi-value, then the record with ID "ASSET&amp;LIAB.US0010001" should be also suitably modified such that the redefined field SECTOR is now the eight multi-value in that record.  </p>
            <p>An example of  an Asset&amp;Liability consolidation file key  is given below to explain the formation of default and Company specific components for the variable parameters:</p>
            <p>Key: AC.1.TR.GBP.1001..1_10.5400_001.8530_8530._8.GB.003_._._100</p>

            <p>To illustrate the use of the field range START.RANGE to COMBINED.CDE the following example is used, which is also included in the "details section" of these two fields START.RANGE and COMBINED.CDE.</p>
            <p>Example : FIELD.NUMBER is sector code. Values on the file are sector codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows:</p>
            <p>o Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3;</p>
            <p>o Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single aggregation;</p>
            <p>o Combination of the remaining values into a single aggregation.</p>

            <p>Note : (i) The enrichment from the file will be displayed if the record exists. If the record does not exist but the value is a possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error. This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the range is currently in use.</p>
            <p>(ii) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those entered are to be combined under one code. When REST is not entered, then the missing values keep their own value.</p>

<desc>
            <p>Identifies whether the conditions specified refer to the Asset and Liability consolidation file (ASSET&amp;LIAB) or the profit and loss consolidation file (PROFIT&amp;LOSS).</p>
            <p>Default and Company specific records are allowed for both consolidation. The ID of the default records would be ASSET&amp;LIAB and PROFIT&amp;LOSS. The IDs of Company specific records for the Company with ID xxxxxxxxx would be ASSET&amp;LIAB.xxxxxxxxx and PROFIT&amp;LOSS.xxxxxxxxx.  </p>
            <p>In Company specific consolidation records,  the variables which depend on the general file 'CUSTOMER', need to be redefined  only if the Company level definition is different.  If  for a CUSTOMER variable, there is no Company level redefinition only the first component would be formed in the consolidation keys. Variables  which depend on the Application files (FILE.NAME is LOCAL) could be redefined at Company level by: Definition of the Variable Name (Field: NAME) and File Name (FIELD;FILE.NAME); Define application specific values  in the fields MULTI.VALUE.NO to CON.ON.END for all  applications, for which the Company specific component needs to be formed. If a variable is to be defined only at Company level without any default definition, then in the default consolidation record the file name of NO LOOKUP is used for the variable.</p>
            <p>Example : </p>
            <p>1. ID CONSOLIDATE.KEY - ASSET&amp;LIAB (Default record)</p>
            <p>For the ASSET&amp;LIAB consolidation, we have supposed that we want to refer to the SECTOR and RESIDENCE code on the CUSTOMER file (general file). From the 'LOCAL' (Application) files, we have selected the CATEGORY and MATURITY fields. The field INDUSTRY would be defined only in Company specific records and in the default record it is defined with the FILE.NAME of  "NO LOOKUP".</p>

            <p>Example : FIELD.NUMBER is sector code. Values on the file are sector codes 1 to 10, 13, 14 and 18. Aggregation must be as follows:</p>
            <p>o Single aggregation of the values 1 to 3;</p>
            <p>o Combination of the values 4 to 7 into a single aggregation;</p>

If the record does not exist but the value is a possible valid value, then the enrichment 'RECORD CURRENTLY NOT ON FILE' is displayed and this is not treated as an error. This allows for ranges to be loaded when only part of the range is currently in use.</p>
            <p>(ii) The value of 'REST' is used when the values other than those entered are to be combined under one code. When REST is not entered, then the missing values keep their own value.</p>
