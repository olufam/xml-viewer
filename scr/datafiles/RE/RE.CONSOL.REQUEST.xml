            <p>Overview Consolidation/Reporting-Amount Abbreviation </p>
            <p>This application is used to produce CRF reports for combination of companies. </p>
            <p>This file holds details of the requests for different reports. </p>
            <p>These requests can be run as part of the end of day processsing in the Batch process called EB.CONSOL.PRINT or online using the V verification function for this application. </p>
            <p>Details that are included in a request are the Crf report, the level of the report, the currency of the report, the consolidation group and where and which exchange rates are to be used. </p>
            <p>It is the local currency amounts, from the CRF base, that are are converted into the reporting currency. The original currency amounts are ignored for combined reporting. </p>
            <p>For each local currency one rate is determined and is used for all the Companies with that local currency irrespective of whether there are different set of exchange rates for each company. </p>
            <p>The Exchange rates can be taken from the following places - a) From a record on the Re.Rpt.Ccy.Rate file. This option is refered to as the SPECIAL rates. b) From the Currency file for each local currency. If more than one Currency for a local currency then the one to be used is specified on the Company.Consol record. This option is refered to as the COMPANY level rates. c) From one of the Currency files. This file will have been specified on the Company.Consol record. These rates are considered to be the DEFAULT rates. </p>
            <p>If a particular rate is missing from the level requested it is obtained using the next level down or by using the Master company's Currency file and calculating cross rates where required. </p>
