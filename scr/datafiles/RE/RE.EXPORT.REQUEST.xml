            <p>This is a Type W Application to do the Import of CRB data from a database. The record details will have to be setup and a "V"erify function will actually perform the Import process during the Online session. </p>
            <p>The "SYSTEM" record in the file F.RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER has to be present before running the Export process. </p>

            <p>It is it be noted that each Multi value will be treated as a separate executable command. The Sub-value markers will be removed prior to execution of the Transfer command. </p>
            <p>Unix commands MUST be entered in the format SH -c "unix.command" (the double quotes are mandatory). Windows NT uses the format DOS /c [command pathname].</p>

<field>RESERVED.3</field>
<desc>
            <p>This is a flag 'Y' or 'N' to specify if the CRB Report lines need to be recalculated immediately after the Import is complete.. </p>
            <p>If 'Y' is specified here, the CRB Report lines for the Report Names specified in the file RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER (field REP.NAMES) will be Recalculated according to the setup in the Import database after the Import of the CRB data is complete. </p>
            <p>It is to be noted that the Recalculation could take quite some time for some databases and care should be taken if 'Y' is specified in this field and 'ALL.COMP' is specified in CO.TO.IMPORT. </p>
            <p>If only the Recalculation is required for a particular company (without the Transfer or Import of the CRB data) the suggested procedure is to sign on to that "Reporting" company and run the Application RE.RECALC.REP.LINES. </p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

            <p>Multi-valued field listing each company for which the CRB data has to be exported. </p>
            <p>The value "ALL.COMP" can be entered in this field so that ALL companies defined in the "SYSTEM" record in RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER will be used to export the CRB data. </p>
            <p>This field will enable the user to export data from a few of the companies defined on the RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER file i.e. if the user wants to export the CRB data of only one of the three companies defined in RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER then that company can be entered in this field. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

            <p />
            <p>The 9 digit Company code or the 3 digit company mnemonic         for each of the companies. </p>
            <p>Multi-value field to allow input of more than one Company.         Optional field. If left blank, no action will be taken on         any of the CRB data.</p>
            <p>If a company code is entered here, it will be checked         against RE.TRANSFER.PARAMETER to see if it has been         defined there.</p>
