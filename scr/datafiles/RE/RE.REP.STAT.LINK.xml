            <p>OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATION/REPORTING - LINK </p>
            <p>The file RE.REP.STAT.LINK allows definition of calendar periods or breakdowns for all consolidation keys with a date. </p>
            <p>It logic is based on remaining number of days from the reporting date. </p>
            <p>A record must be established for each line of the type LINK for each report. In addition to the period breakdown definitions the user controls the narratives, the blank lines and the totalling on each set of definitions. </p>
            <p>The use of the file is optional within the consolidation static parameter file set-up but if used is dependent on the files RE.STAT.COL.TYPE and RE.STAT.REP.HEAD. </p>

<field>PERIOD.END</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field allows the definition of the period breakdowns expressed as number of days, months or years. </p>
            <p>The PERIOD END definition can be done in several ways. Any combination of RM and X values can be used to build a calendar for the period breakdown. </p>
            <p>For example the definition:      6.1.1   7D                                  6.1.2   RM                                  6.1.3   1M                                  6.1.4   3M                                  6.1.5   1Y </p>
            <p>           will result in the following period            breakdowns based on say November 1            reporting date: </p>
            <p>           up to (next) 7 days   Nov.  8            up to (next) 7 days   Nov. 15            up to (next) 7 days   Nov. 22            up to (next) 7 days   Nov. 29            up to end current mth Nov. 30            up to (next) 1 month  Dec. 31            up to (next) 3 months Mar. 31            up to (next) 1 year   Mar. 31            etc.                  Mar. 31            etc. </p>
            <p>           The definition of     6.1.1  1M            will result in: </p>
            <p>           up to (next) month    Dec.  1            up to (next) month    Jan.  1            etc                   Feb.  1            etc </p>
            <p>If the definition contains the values RM and/or D only,  then the fields 8.1 to 15.1 can be used to define the period breakdowns after the current month end by half months, months, quarters and years </p>
            <p>If the number of days specified exceed the current end of month, the day period will be carried into the second month and the next higher (longer) period will end at the correct date but only start the day after the nD period has ended. </p>
            <p>Example: Reporting Date October 26, 1986          Period Breakdown    6.1.1  =  7D                              8.1    =  12M </p>
            <p>         The following end dates will be obtained: </p>
            <p>         November  2, 1986 (+ 7 days)          November 15, 1986 (Half-month of 13 days)          November 30, 1986 (Half-month of 15 days)          December 15, 1986 (Half-month of 15 days)          etc. </p>
