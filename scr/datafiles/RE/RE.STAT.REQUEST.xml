            <p>OVERVIEW OF RE STAT REQUEST </p>
            <p>This application is used to load details of the CRF reports that are to be printed in the batch run. </p>
            <p>It is also used to run CRF reports on-line as at the close of business on the previous working day. </p>
            <p>The functions (I)nput, (C)opy, (L)ist, (P)rint, (R)eversal, S(ee) and V(erify) are available. </p>
            <p>The (I)nput and (C)opy functions are used to load the records to the file. </p>
            <p>The V(erify) function is used to produce the reports during the on-line day. </p>
            <p>For the reports to be produced as part of the batch run the key of the appropriate record is to entered into the Data field of the EB.STAT.PRINT batch record. </p>
