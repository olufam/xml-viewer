            <p>This application is only used in conjunction with RE.STAT.LINE.CHANGE and indeed, is only run when there is a problem with RE.STAT.LINE.CHANGE. </p>
            <p>Wherever RE.STAT.LINE.CHANGE is run, to move lines around within a specific report, then the files are backed up in case the change is not completed and the user wishes to restore them.  It is this program, RE.STAT.LINE.RECOVERY, that is used to restore the files. </p>
