            <p>OVERVIEW CONSOLIDATION/REPORTING - RANGES </p>
            <p>The file RE.STAT.RANGE contains definitions of a range of values or a set of individual values for a report line content definition. </p>
            <p>It will allow setting up of "standard", often used or virtual views as a help or short cut in the report line definition process. (e.g. the consolidation key as one of its components contains the domicile code and a reporting requirement in one or more reports requires grouping of Common Market countries, a record with the corresponding domicile codes can be defined). </p>
            <p>The eventual usage of the defined range will be recorded by the system and reversals of ranges will be monitored/not allowed if they are still in use. </p>
