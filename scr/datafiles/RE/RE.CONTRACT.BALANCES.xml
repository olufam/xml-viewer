            <p>The RE.CONTRACT.BALANCES file records all CRB financial movements and CRB balance details of a particular T24 application contract. </p>
            <p>The purpose of this file is to : </p>
            <p>  1.  provide drill down information from a reporting line   2.  be used as the basis for the CRB rebuild   3.  be used as the basis for CRB static changes. </p>
            <p>Both current and historical details are maintained providing a means by which the system can control and record all financial transactions. </p>
            <p>This file also provides a valuable source of information for enquiry and reporting purposes for both bank and customer requirements. </p>
            <p>The file is updated automatically by any routines which modify CRB balance details.  There is no facility for direct input to this file.  The only functions that users are allowed to perform are "L"ist, "S"ee, and "P"rint. </p>
            <p>The following associated information is held on this file : </p>
            <p>  o  Currency of the balance   o  Multi-valued set of fields detailing CRB asset types and      associated value date, maturity date, and amount of      outstanding CRB balance.   o  Consol key.   o  Customer number.   o  Interest rate, key, and basis. </p>
            <p>Note : </p>
            <p>Two RE.CONTRACT.BALANCES records, Asset and Liability, are created whenever a Swap contract is entered into the system and remain there as long as the contract remains "Live". The Ids of the two records are the same as their associated SWAP.BALANCES records (SWAP.BALANCES stores all contract balance information, principal outstanding, accruals, interest paid/received, rate changes, etc.). </p>
            <p>Eg. Swap contract SW9503100001.     The associated RE.CONTRACT.BALANCES records created for     this contract would be SW9503100001.A and SW9503100001.L. </p>
