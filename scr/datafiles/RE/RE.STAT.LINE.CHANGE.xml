            <p>OVERVIEW OF RE STAT LINE CHANGE </p>
            <p>This application is used to move lines around within one specific report. </p>
            <p>The function (I)nput (C)opy, (L)ist, (P)rint, (R)eversal.  S(ee) and (V)erify are available. </p>
            <p>The functions (I)nput and (C)opy are used to load the records into the file. </p>
            <p>The V(erify) function is used to actually move the lines and update all associated files. </p>
            <p>The V(erify) function can not be run while a user is updating the RE.STAT.REP.LINE file. </p>
            <p>First stage of the Verification after verify data is in order is to back up the files.  If the program fails after the back up stage then the application RE.STAT.LINE.RECOVERY is to be run to restore files. This is necessary as the number of journal record parameters could exceed maximum allowed. </p>
