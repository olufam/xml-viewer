<ovdesc>

            <p>Wealth Management Valuation Workfile. Holds valuation data extracted from SC.VALUATION.EXTRACT, which is itself extracted from SC.POS.ASSET.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  AM.VAL.EXTRACT.WRK exists so that for an operator we can retrieve the data from 1 of 14 files, (Live and 13 rolling historical files). So the data you get in this file is transitory and can be either current/live or historical data. </p>
            <p />
            <p> The key is made up as follows:</p>
            <p />
            <p> Portfolio No.:'.': Security :'.': Depository :'.':Todays Date (Not applicable on AM.VAL.EXTRACT.WRK):'.':Asset Type:'.':Sub Asset Type:'.D'</p>
            <p />
            <p> Where Security is taken from the SC.POS.ASSET SECURITY.NO.</p>
            <p> Records can be suffixed “.D” or “.P” D is current live data. “.P” is pending data.</p>
            <p> On AM.VAL.EXTRACT.WRK you also get a *???? Value, which is the operator id.</p>

<field>COST.PRICE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position. This field will contain the cost of the position. The actual calculation done for this field will depend on the type of position this set of values represents.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.VALUATION.EXTRACT file. It is calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p />
            <p>    COST.PRICE = (COST.INVST * PERC.FACTOR) / (NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR)</p>
            <p />
            <p>    Where COST.INVST is the value contained in the COST.INVST.SEC.CCY field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). NOMINAL is the closing nominal balance fould from the SECURITY.POSITION record field CLOSING.BAL.NO.NOM. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract. It is retained as the cost price until the contact matures and is removed from the portfolio valuation.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Forward Rate Agreement then this field will contain the value in the INTEREST.RATE field of the original contract.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for an Account then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Money Market contract or for a Loans and Deposits contract then this field will be blank.</p>
            <p />

            <p />
            <p>    For all positions other than Securities (SC) and Fiduciaries (FD) then the Margin Rate will come from the MARGIN.RATE field in the ASSET.BY.CATEG record for the CATEGORY of the position - if there is one - and then default to the MARGIN.RATE field on the ASSET.TYPE record the position is linked to if there is no ASSET.BY.CATEG record.

            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Fiduciary (FD) contract then the system will first try to find the margin rate from the ASSET.BY.CATEG file, then use the MARGIN.RATE field on the FD.FID.ORDER record before finally using the ASSET.TYPE record if a margin rate has not been set-up on either of the other files.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Securities (SC) contract then the system will first see if there is a MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the SECURITY.MASTER record for the Security. If there is the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.CONTROL record. If there is no MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the Security then the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.RATE field of the SUB.ASSET.TYPE record the position is connected to.</p>

This is because the value of the contract to the portfolio depends on the exchange rates of the individual currencies on the deal against the reference currency of the portfolio at the time of the contract and at the time of rebuilding the portfolio valuation data. The value is then the difference (i.e. revaluation using the rebate method).</p>

<field>GR.COST.PRICE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is a multi-valued field associated with all the other fields in this file. It is only updated is the set of values associated with this particular value are for a security position otherwise this field will be blank.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>    If the position concerned is for a security then this field will contain the gross cost price for a single security expressed in the security currency of the security (which will be the security in the associated SECURITY.CCY field). It is calculated using the GROSS.COST.SEC.CCY field from the SECURITY.POSITION record represented by this set of values. It is calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p />
            <p>    GROSS.COST = (COST.INVST * PERC.FACTOR) / (NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR) Where COST.INVST is the value contained in the GROSS.COST.SEC.CCY field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). NOMINAL is the closing nominal balance found from the SECURITY.POSITION record field CLOSING.BAL.NO.NOM. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the gross cost price is pro-rated.</p>

<field>V.DATE.COST</field>
<desc>
            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position. This field will contain the cost of the position. The actual calculation done for this field will depend on the type of position this set of values represents.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>    The value of this field is calculated in a similar way to the COST.PRICE field but using value dated positions.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a security then this figure contains the calculated cost for a single security in the security currency. It is calculated using the VALUE.DATED.COST field from the SECURITY.POSITION record that gave rise to this entry on the SC.VALUATION.EXTRACT file. It is calculated as follows ;</p>
            <p />
            <p>    COST.PRICE = (VD.COST * PERC.FACTOR) / (VD.NOMINAL * MULT.FACTOR)</p>
            <p />
            <p>    Where VD.COST is the value contained in the VALUE.DATED.COST field on the SECURITY.POSITION record. PERC.FACTOR is 100 if the Security price is expressed in percentage terms (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security) and 1 otherwise. MULT.FACTOR is the multiplication factor for the security (found from the PRICE.TYPE record associated with the security). VD.NOMINAL is the value dated nominal balance found from the SECURITY.POSITION record field VALUE.DATED.POSN. If the position is built from more than one SECURITY.POSITION record then the COST.PRICE is pro-rated.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a FOREX contract then this field will contain the exchange rate of the deal (if the portfolio reference currency is one of the currencies involved in the deal) or the market or forward rate between the currency in the associated SECURITY.CCY value and the portfolio reference currency at the time of the original contract. It is retained as the cost price until the contact matures and is removed from the portfolio valuation.</p>

<field>MARGIN.VALUE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Multivalued field associated with all the other fields in the file to give details of a portfolio position.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    This field contains a Margin value for the portfolio position. If the position is a debit or a short position then this field will be equal to the associated ESTIMATION field. Otherwise this field will contain a value calculated by multiplying the ESTIMATION amount by the Margin Rate for the position.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    For all positions other than Securities (SC) and Fiduciaries (FD) then the Margin Rate will come from the MARGIN.RATE field in the ASSET.BY.CATEG record for the CATEGORY of the position - if there is one - and then default to the MARGIN.RATE field on the ASSET.TYPE record the position is linked to if there is no ASSET.BY.CATEG record. If the margin rate has not been entered on either of these files a rate os 0 is used.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Fiduciary (FD) contract then the system will first try to find the margin rate from the ASSET.BY.CATEG file, then use the MARGIN.RATE field on the FD.FID.ORDER record before finally using the ASSET.TYPE record if a margin rate has not been set-up on either of the other files.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    If the position is for a Securities (SC) contract then the system will first see if there is a MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the SECURITY.MASTER record for the Security. If there is the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.CONTROL record. If there is no MARGIN.CONTROL record connected to the Security then the margin rate will be taken from the MARGIN.RATE field of the SUB.ASSET.TYPE record the position is connected to.</p>
