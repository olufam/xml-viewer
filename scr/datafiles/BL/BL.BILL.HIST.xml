            <p>OVERVIEW</p>
            <p>History file of BL.BILL</p>
            <p>The individual Bill Registers and Bill Batches are attached and made as a contract through this application.</p>
            <p>The id for this application is auto generated once it is defined in AUTO.ID.START and COMPANY files. The id format is BLYYDDDNNNNN.</p>
            <p>It is possible to include both individual Bills and Bill Batches in a Bill Contract. When a </p>
            <p>BL.BATCH </p>is included in a Bill Contract, the system would expand and display all the <p>BL.REGISTERS </p>attached to the Batch. Only authorized <p>BL.REGISTERS and </p><p>BL.BATCHES </p>could be included in a Bill Contract. <p>A </p><p>BL.REGISTER </p>or <p>BL.BATCH </p>already included in a Bill Contract could not be included again in another Bill Contract. <p>The system would ensure that all the </p><p>BL.REGISTERS </p>attached to a Bill Contract (either directly or through Batches) are of the same currency and with same <p>LIABILITY.CUSTOMER </p>as specified in the Contract. Bills of different Liability Customers cannot be attached in a Bill Contract.<p /><p>While it is possible to attach </p><p>BL.REGISTERS </p>of different <p>BL.TYPE </p>in the same batch, it is not possible to have a contract by attaching different <p>BL.TYPES. </p>However, if the <p>BL.TYPE </p>is of the same product, it can be batched and the Contract can be made. <p>The system would ensure that all the </p><p>BL.REGISTERS </p>attached to a Bill Contract (either directly or through Batches) have their <p>START.DATE </p>not later than the <p>VALUE.DATE </p>of<p />the Bill Contract. <p>It is possible to include </p><p>BL.REGISTERS </p>maturing on different dates in a Bill contract. <p>It is possible to Add/Remove </p><p>BL.REGISTERS/BL.BATCHES </p>to an already authorised Bill Contract. <p>Copy Option is not allowed in this Application.</p><p /><p>After the no of days as mentioned in BL.PARAMETER to move it to history from the date of maturity of the BL contract, these details will be moved to history file- BL.BILL.HIST.</p><p /><p /></p>

            <p>BL.BILL.HIST - BL BILL</p>
            <p>INT.KEY</p>
            <p>This is an optional  input field. The default mechanism (see below) will happen as per below automatically along with other fields ( INT.SPREAD,INT.RATE).</p>
            <p>Default Mechanism</p>
            <p>1.</p>
            <p />The system would first look for an appropriate BTTC record and take the values defined therein. Then it would use the values defined in appropriate BGC record for modification/override purposes. Finally it could use the values from BL.PARAMETER. It is possible that some of the fields<p />in BTTC or BGC records are not defined (null values). As a general rule, the system would skip these fields and<p />use the values defined at the next level of parameter records. <p>2.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract are same then the system would first look for a BTTC record with key "DISCOUNT*NNNN" where "NNNN" is the value of the common Bill-Type. If there is no such record<p />then the system would look for a record with key "DISCOUNT". <p>3.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract is<p />not the same, then the system would only look for a BTTC record with key DISCOUNT. <p>4.</p><p />The system would first update the Contract Group field in Bills Contract; it would determine which is the first<p />Contract Group defined in APPL.GEN.CONDITION file (Record Key: BL)which satisfy the Bill Contract conditions.<p />If no contract group defined therein satisfies the Bill Contract conditions, the system would not update<p />the Contract Group field in<p />the Bills Contract. <p>5.</p><p />The BGC file could have records<p />with key values of either "C-Customer No." or a valid Bill Contract Group. In BGC, the system would first look for a record with key "C-Customer No.". If<p />the record<p />does not exist, then the system would look for a record with key equal to the Contract Group field in the Bills Contract. <p>6.</p><p />The values in BGC record fields could in some cases override the BTTC values are in some cases could modify the BTTC values. It is possible that both BTTC and BGC records are not available or that the values for some fields are not defined in these records. In such cases, the values from the BL.PARAMETER file <p />would be used by the system to default the values. <p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p /><p>Valid BASIC.INTEREST or PERIODIC.INTEREST key is allowed   </p><p>To specify PERIODIC.INTEREST key, prefix the "P" with the     interest key. (Example: For periodic interest key "01" ,specify it     as "P01")   </p><p>Interest Key is allowed only when the Interest Rate is NULL.</p><p /></desc>

            <p>The CONTRACT.GRP code is determined every time the contract is changed by evaluating the conditions defined in the BILLS record of the APPL.GEN.CONDITION application. (see  APPL.GEN.CONDTION for more information).</p>

            <p>For example :</p>
            <p>If 10 BR's attached to a BL cleared and instead of changing the status of each BR, overall collection status can be changed to "Cleared". Similarly if 2 BR's returned out of 10 BR's, mark the individual BR's collection status as "Returned" and change the overall status to "Cleared"</p>

            <p>Default Mechanism</p>
            <p>1.</p>
            <p />The system would first look for an appropriate BTTC record and take the values defined therein. Then it would use the values defined in appropriate BGC record for modification/override purposes. Finally it could use the values from BL.PARAMETER. It is possible that some of the fields<p />in BTTC or BGC records are not defined (null values). As a general rule, the system would skip these fields and<p />use the values defined at the next level of parameter records. <p>2.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract are same then the system would first look for a BTTC record with key "DISCOUNT*NNNN" where "NNNN" is the value of the common Bill-Type. If there is no such record<p />then the system would look for a record with key "DISCOUNT". <p>3.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract is<p />not the same, then the system would only look for a BTTC record with key DISCOUNT. <p>4.</p><p />The system would first update the Contract Group field in Bills Contract; it would determine which is the first<p />Contract Group defined in APPL.GEN.CONDITION file (Record Key: BL)which satisfy the Bill Contract conditions.<p />If no contract group defined therein satisfies the Bill Contract conditions, the system would not update<p />the Contract Group field in<p />the Bills Contract. <p>5.</p><p />The BGC file could have records<p />with key values of either "C-Customer No." or a valid Bill Contract Group. In BGC, the system would first look for a record with key "C-Customer No.". If<p />the record<p />does not exist, then the system would look for a record with key equal to the Contract Group field in the Bills Contract. <p>6.</p><p />The values in BGC record fields could in some cases override the BTTC values are in some cases could modify the BTTC values. It is possible that both BTTC and BGC records are not available or that the values for some fields are not defined in these records. In such cases, the values from the BL.PARAMETER file <p />would be used by the system to default the values. <p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p /><p /><p>Interest     rate is allowed if the Interest key and Interest spread is NULL</p></desc>
