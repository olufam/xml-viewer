            <p>Default Mechanism</p>
            <p>1.</p>
            <p />The system would first look for an appropriate BTTC record and take the values defined therein. Then it would use the values defined in appropriate BGC record for modification/override purposes. Finally it could use the values from BL.PARAMETER. It is possible that some of the fields<p />in BTTC or BGC records are not defined (null values). As a general rule, the system would skip these fields and<p />use the values defined at the next level of parameter records. <p>2.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract are same then the system would first look for a BTTC record with key "DISCOUNT*NNNN" where "NNNN" is the value of the common Bill-Type. If there is no such record<p />then the system would look for a record with key "DISCOUNT". <p>3.</p><p />If Bill-Type of all Bill Registers attached to a Bill Contract is<p />not the same, then the system would only look for a BTTC record with key DISCOUNT. <p>4.</p><p />The system would first update the Contract Group field in Bills Contract; it would determine which is the first<p />Contract Group defined in APPL.GEN.CONDITION file (Record Key: BL)which satisfy the Bill Contract conditions.<p />If no contract group defined therein satisfies the Bill Contract conditions, the system would not update<p />the Contract Group field in<p />the Bills Contract. <p>5.</p><p />The BGC file could have records<p />with key values of either "C-Customer No." or a valid Bill Contract Group. In BGC, the system would first look for a record with key "C-Customer No.". If<p />the record<p />does not exist, then the system would look for a record with key equal to the Contract Group field in the Bills Contract. <p>6.</p><p />The values in BGC record fields could in some cases override the BTTC values are in some cases could modify the BTTC values. It is possible that both BTTC and BGC records are not available or that the values for some fields are not defined in these records. In such cases, the values from the BL.PARAMETER file <p />would be used by the system to default the values.  <p><p>Validation Rules:</p></p><p /><p>Must be a valid record in BASIC.INTEREST or PERIODIC.INTEREST</p><p>Either Interest key or Interest rate is allowed.</p><p>To specify PERIODIC.INTEREST - specify interest key prefixed with "P"       (ie. To specify PERIODIC.INTEREST key "01" - it is "P01")</p></desc>

            <p>When contract is inputted through BL module the charges and interest rate will be defaulted based on the key of operation and type of BL.</p>

            <p>This is an optional  input field along with other associated fields. The Interest Rate has to be defined here.</p>
