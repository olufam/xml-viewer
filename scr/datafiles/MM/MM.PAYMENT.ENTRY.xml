            <p>The Payment Entry Function is an on-line application that provides the user with two major facilities: </p>
            <p>(i)        Input of 'manual' payment entries:            i.e. a function that allows the user to instruct the                 system to process a payment for a Money                 Market Contract. </p>
            <p>(ii)       Display of both manual and automatic payment            entries:            i.e. a function that allows the user to view the                 major components in any pament that was                 generated by the money market system. </p>
            <p>Input of Manual Payment Entries </p>
            <p>This facility can only be used for Liability type  contracts (except Fiduciary Deposits), that is, where the user bank pays funds to a counterparty in respect of a deposit made by that counterparty and where the funds in question are paid away for any date other than the normal scheduled action due dates on that contract. </p>
            <p>Money Market contracts are always liquidated automatically on scheduled due dates and so it only makes sense to use this application PRIOR to the due dates to register a prepayment of principal.  Only Principal amount can be prepaid in the MM.PAYMENT.ENTRY facility. </p>
            <p>Following validation/authorisation all necessary files are updated, accounting/limit entries are passed and the delivery system is called to send the payment (if needed) together with the appropriate advice confirmation. </p>
            <p>It must be noted that once a payment entry has been authorised, it cannot be changed.  Any error will need to be corrected by the reversal of the payment entry and a new input with the correct information.  Only the last payment entry can be reversed. </p>
            <p>This application will not allow the processing of payment entries for contracts which have been defined with the INTEREST BASIS equal to 'S'. </p>
            <p>Display of both Manual and Automatic Payment entries </p>
            <p>Apart from 'manual' payment entries that are described above, the Money Market System also writes 'automatic' payment entry records whenever it needs to make a payment.  An example of when this occurs is when a placement contract is loaded with a value date of 'today' and payment instructions requiring a payment.  Upon authorisation of such a contract, a payment is 'automatically' made by the system. </p>
            <p>Another example is when a deposit matures during the 'off-line' processing.  If the payment instructions require a payment to be made then the Money Market System 'automatically' sends the payment (via the delivery system). </p>
            <p>If the user ever wants to see the major components of these 'automatic' payments (or indeed review a 'manual' payment) then he can use the MM.PAYMENT.ENTRY application in (S)EE mode.  This displays the principal and interest paid, the tax and charges that were deducted, and the net payment amount. </p>
            <p>It should be noted that: </p>
            <p>(i)        update functions (e.g. INPUT) are not allowed for            'automatic' payments. </p>
            <p>(ii)       one automatic payment entry may result in one, two            or no physical payment messages. </p>
            <p>           -    1 physical payment message is produced if all                 payment instructions of all components are                 the same. </p>
            <p>           -    2 physical payment messages are produced if                 the principal payment instructions differ from                 the interest payment instruction. </p>
            <p>           -    No physical payment messages are produced                 if the customer of the nostro account being                 credited is the same as the beneficiary                 customer.  In this case the confirmation                 suffices. </p>

<field>OVERRIDES</field>
<desc>
            <p>Contains all the overrides messages which the User agreed to during input. </p>
            <p>During the validation stage of of a payment entry record the system may provide the User with a series of screen override messages to indicate an anomaly, for example that the value date of the proposed payment is not a working day. </p>
            <p>In the event that the User confirms the override the full text of the actual override message will be stored, for reference purposes only, in this multivalue field. </p>
            <p>If, subsequently, the payment entry record is either fully displayed on the screen or printed, then all override messages will be present.  Thus if a more senior officer wishes to authorise data which has been input his attention will be drawn immediately to any unusual aspects of the deal which will be reflected in these override messages. </p>

            <p>Identifies the amount of principal that is being paid. </p>
            <p>The User will employ this field to specify that amount which is to be paid on the contract as a principal amount. </p>
            <p>Note:      It is obvious that any principal paid with a VALUE            DATE smaller than the contract MATURITY DATE or            the next INT DUE DATE will have an effect on the            interest amount of the transaction which will be            recalculated to take into account this repayment of            principal. </p>

            <p>If INTEREST BASIS 'S' is employed in the contract then the payment of an amount of principal (partial or total) is not allowed.</p>

<field>CURRENCY.CODE</field>

            <p>Indicates the currency of the contract. </p>
            <p>In the Money Market Module this field indicates the currency of the contract and will be the same as the currency of the various accounts where any accounting movements in respect of the contract will be debited or credited. </p>

<field>ACTIVITY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Each advice related activity within the Money Market and Loans and Deposits Modules is identified by a numeric code which is hard-coded within the program.  The appropriate code is automatically inserted at this field by the system. </p>
            <p>This field is linked to the LMM.ACIVITY file which is a list of advice related activities used by the Money Market Module. </p>
            <p>Each activity has been assigned a numeric code all of which are themselves hard-coded in the program.  These codes/activities must be loaded by the User in the LMM.ACTIVITY file. </p>
            <p>These codes are transparent to the User except in the LMM.ACTIVITY and LMM.ADVICES tables, i.e. the system recognises when an event occurs.  Thus the field would contain an advice related activity code that may have been passed to the E.B.S. Delivery Module as a result of the payment entry in question. </p>
            <p>The field is multi-value to allow for multiple entries. </p>
            <p>The only activity codes generated by the MM.PAYMENT. ENTRY are: </p>
            <p>           1050 = Early Liquidation            2080 = Separate Customer Remarks advice </p>

            <p>Specifies whether the information contained in CUST REMARKS (Field 44) is to be sent as part of any standard advice/confirmation or whether it is to be sent as a separate communication. </p>
            <p>The inclusion of this field allows the User additional flexibility in respect of communication of text to the counterparty. Two values are defined for this field. </p>
            <p>(1)        Input of 'A' will mean that any text inserted at the            previous field will be sent to the counterparty as an            entirely separate communication i.e. the advice            generated according to the activity code 2080. </p>
            <p>(2)        Input of 'M' will mean that any text inserted at the            previous field will be included on any standard form            of confirmation/advice that would normally have been            sent in connection with the payment entry record in            question i.e. the advice generated according to the            activity code 1050. </p>
