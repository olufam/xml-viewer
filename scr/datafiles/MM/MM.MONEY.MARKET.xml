            <p>The Money Market Module processes all types of deposits and placements and has been designed to fulfil dealers and management requirements for the multicurrency assets and liabilities transactions of a commercial bank.  Administration, control and accounting of the various products covered by the Module are all fully automated.  The main deal types handled can be classified as follows:</p>
            <p>Placements/Loans</p>
            <p>A contract to lend a fixed amount of money in a specific currency.  The interest rate can be agreed for the complete period of the contract or can be dependent on any base rates such as prime rate, base rate, deposit rate, call rate etc..  The period of time can be fixed i.e. the contract is for an agreed length of time or can be on a 'call' or 'notice' basis.</p>
            <p>Deposits</p>
            <p>A contract to deposit with the bank a fixed amount of money in a specific currency.  The interest rate and the period of time can be agreed on the same basis as previously stated for Placements/Loans.</p>
            <p>Fiduciary Deposits/Placements</p>
            <p>A transaction whereby the bank acting as a fiduciary or agent receives a deposit and places the funds at the direction of the depositor.  The bank earns a commission for acting as the fiduciary agent.  These off-balance sheet transactions are handled in much the same way as the two previous products with some additional facilities such as:</p>
            <p>-          The user will only maintain one side of the transaction            (Deposit) i.e. the associated placement is automatically            generated and maintained by the System.</p>
            <p>-          Interest payment facilities are provided at the group            level, i.e. the Fiduciary Bank level within currency and            notice period.</p>
            <p>-          Fiduciary commission rates can be defined on tables or            specifically input at the contract level.</p>
            <p>Sundry Assets and Liabilities</p>
            <p>Which will allow a record to be made at the customers level of miscellaneous items due to/from customers.</p>
            <p>The main features of this Module are:</p>
            <p>Various input stages for the recording of the deal data.  A first input level will allow primary deal information to be entered by the dealer while the settlement details can be entered at a second input level by the back-office.  Primary details will be restricted to a minimum enabling the dealer to enter the data in a matter of seconds but still providing sufficient information to allow real time updates of all the relevant positions (Limit Exposure, Cash Flow, Liquidity etc.).</p>
            <p>All deal types are handled in local and foreign currencies i.e. contracts can be denominated in any currency.  It must be noted however that all deal types will be 'non-positional' in the sense that all entries will be generated in the currency of the contract.</p>
            <p>Interest accruals can be performed on a daily, weekly, monthly or on a requested basis.</p>
            <p>Fixed, Libor, Prime, Base, Call and any other interest rate are handled.</p>
            <p>Fixed and Call/Notice maturity are allowed.  Upon the liquidation of a notice transaction, the Application will verify that the notice period has been duly respected and any shorter notice will require an override.</p>
            <p>Automatic production and delivery of confirmations, advices and payments.  Confirmation and Broker notices received may be matched to deal inputs and verified or unconfirmed deals extracted using a special confirmation enquiry facility.</p>
            <p>Multi-settlement conditions: Each contract contains the payment conditions applicable to both disbursement and receipt of funds. Different conditions between Principal and Interest may be recorded and Interest on Call and Notice transactions can be liquidated at various times during the life of the deal.</p>
            <p>Interest accrual adjustments, due to back value changes in the interest rate, are handled automatically by the Application up to the last interest due date.</p>
            <p>Tax on interest.  On deposit contracts, a tax rate or key can be specified to allow automatic deduction of the tax from the interest amount on payment date.  This tax amount will be kept in a liability account until its liquidation to the local Authorities.</p>
            <p>Interest payments will always be liquidated in arrears, i.e. on maturity date or on intermediary interest payment date (s) defined in the contract.  Discounted transactions will be handled by the Loans and Deposits Module.</p>
            <p>Detailed statistics, in respect of broker positions and brokerage are available on the number of transactions per broker.  Automated brokerage calculation and processing is controlled by the BROKER file. A rollover function is available which will enable the User to renew existing contracts at maturity when the new conditions that will apply to a contract are known in advance of the maturity date of that contract.</p>
            <p>The System provides automatic liquidation of all maturing contracts on the maturity date (regardless of whether or not funds are received on the due date in respect of placement contracts).</p>
            <p>The System also provides a Payment/Receipt function which enables the User to instruct the System to make a payment out of a contractor conversely, to inform the System that money has been received on a contract outside a normal due date e.g. a prepayment on a loan.</p>
            <p>The Money Market Module is an important source of detailed management information for the production of comprehensive general reports such as:</p>
            <p>.          Cash Flow .          Liquidity Position .          Nostro position .          Interest Rate Exposure .          Interest rate sensitivity ('what if' - situation)</p>
            <p>The System provides comprehensive on-line inquiry and reporting facilities such as:</p>
            <p>-          Activity Journal -          Limits -          Exception Report including deals for which settlement            details are incomplete -          Maturity Report -          Confirmations outstanding and Chasers. -          Broker Notices missing -          List of all deals by:            .    customer            .    currency            .    maturity date            .    amount            .    interest rate            .    account officer            .    department            .    country</p>

<field>INT.BEN.BANK.2</field>
<desc>
            <p>Contains the Customer reference for the second Beneficiary Bank for the Interest Amount.  Used where contracts involve four party transfers of funds and where disposal of interest on Deposits will be different from disposal of principal.</p>
            <p>If for example, at the maturity of a Deposit the customer requests the delivery of the interest to his account that he maintains with American Bank A, Detroit which has an account with American Bank B, New York, the User will then make the following input:-</p>
            <p>(i)  Default (or Enter) the standard Nostro account                 number in the INT LIQ ACCT (field 28).  This                 field is always used to indicate the account where                 the book-keeping entries must be recorded by the                 system.            (ii) Enter the Agent code (Customer number) of the                 American Bank B, New York, in the INT BEN                 BANK 1 (field 29).  In case this Bank does not                 exist on the Database, the User can then enter the                 name and address of this Bank in the INT                 ADDRESS (field 31.1).</p>
            <p>(iii)Enter the Agent code (Customer number) of the                 Bank of Detroit in this field.  In case this Bank                 does not exist on the Database but there was a                 Customer reference for the Bank identified in the                 previous field, the User can enter the name and                 address of this Bank in the INT ADDRESS (field                 31.1).  This means that at least one of the two                 banks must have been defined on the CUSTOMER                 and AGENCY files.</p>
            <p>(iv) Enter the beneficiary account number in the                 BENEF INT ACCT (field 30.1).</p>
            <p>Default value is the same as the PRIN BEN BANK2 field when:-</p>
            <p>(i)  The INT LIQ ACCT is the same as the PRIN LIQ                 ACCT</p>
            <p>(ii) The INT BEN BANK1 is the same as the PRIN BEN                 BANK1.</p>
            <p>Once the contract has been authorised, any change to this field will only have an effect on future interest Disbursements.</p>

            <p>Input is only allowed for Deposit contract types.</p>
            <p>Input in this field is only allowed when INT LIQ ACCT is a Nostro.</p>
            <p>Input in this field must correspond to a valid Agent on the AGENCY file.</p>
            <p>When used in conjunction with INT BEN BANK1, the two customer references must differ.</p>
            <p>Input in this field will not be allowed if INT BEN BANK1 (field 29) and INT ADDRESS (field 31.1) have both been entered.</p>

<field>FID.ASSOC.LD.REF</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the ID of the associated Fiduciary Placement which is automatically generated by the System on input of a new Fiduciary Deposit record.</p>
            <p>When a Money Market Fiduciary Deposit is loaded, the system will automatically generate a corresponding Fiduciary Placement contract to match the Fiduciary Deposit.  It will assign a reference number to this Placement contract as follows:</p>
            <p>The User is allowed to identify contracts with the number range 1 to 9999 but the system will always insert an extra digit in front of this User-defined number.  This extra digit is always a 0 for all Money Market contracts other than the automatically generated Fiduciary Placements.  The extra digit for the Fiduciary Placement is always a 9. Thus:-</p>
            <p>MM Fid. Deposit    (User loaded)    - MM/85296/08888</p>
            <p>MM Fid. Placement  (system created) - MM/85296/98888</p>
            <p>where 08888 is the number the User has assigned to identify the Fiduciary Deposit contract and 98888 is the number the system automatically assigns to the corresponding Fiduciary Placement.</p>
            <p>

<t>
<field>CAPITALISATION</field>
<desc>
            <p>Use of this field indicates the requirement for automatic capitalisation of Interest on interest due dates.</p>
            <p>This field has been defined to permit the automatic capitalisation of interest at each liquidation of interest on all Deposit/Placement transactions (Call, Notice and Fixed Maturities.)</p>
            <p>The system will update automatically the principal amount with the full amount of interest and the capitalisation will continue until the final maturity date is reached.</p>
            <p>However, if the interest of the Deposit transaction is subject to local taxes, only the net amount of the interest will be capitalised and the amount of taxes will be credited to the corresponding tax sundry account.</p>
            <p>The following values have been defined:</p>
            <p>i) N = do not capitalise            ii) Y = capitalise.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

<field>PRIN.BEN.BANK.1</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Beneficiary Bank which is to be used for the Principal Amount of Deposit contract types at maturity or for Placement contract types at drawdown when the customer has requested external delivery of the proceeds of the transaction.</p>
            <p>This field is used when the customer does not require the funds to be credited to his current account but instead requests an external delivery of the funds to a Bank different to the one where you maintain your Nostro account.</p>
            <p>If this Beneficiary Bank does not yet exist on the Database, the user may:</p>
            <p>a)         Create a new record in the CUSTOMER and AGENCY files            which will contain the information necessary to generate            automatically advices, confirmations etc... for this bank            or,</p>
            <p>b)         Use the PRIN ADDRESS (field 26.1) to directly input the            name and address of the Beneficiary Bank without having            to create a customer and/or an Agent record.  This            option is very useful if the transaction has to be            liquidated in favour of a Bank which is rarely dealt with.</p>
            <p>Note:      Once the contract has been authorised, any change to            this field will only have an effect on future principal            disbursements.</p>

            <p>For Placements, input in this file will only be allowed when the DRAWDOWN ACCOUNT is a Nostro account.</p>
            <p>For Deposits input in this field will only be allowed when the PRIN LIQ ACCT is a Nostro account.</p>
            <p>Input in this field will be checked against the AGENCY file.  When autorouting instructions have not been defined for the counterparty of the contract in the currency of the deal, input in this field or field 25 or field 26 will be mandatory if the DRAWDOWN account (Placements) or PRIN LIQ ACCT (Deposits) is a Nostro account.</p>
            <p>When used in conjunction with the PRIN BEN BANK 2 field, the two Customer references must differ.</p>
            <p>Input in this field will not be allowed at the same time with an input in PRIN BEN BANK 2 (field 25) and PRIN ADDRESS (field 26).</p>

<field>LIQ.DEFER.INTEREST</field>
<desc>
            <p>Only allowed for Call/Notice contracts and states whether interest is to be liquidated or deferred at the interest due date.</p>
            <p>INT DUE DATE and LIQ.DEFER. INTEREST fields control when interest is due and whether the interest accrued is to be paid/received or not on this date. It is a system requirement that an interest due date is specified for all Call or Notice contracts. However, if the User does not require the interest to be liquidated on this date then the User should set this field (LIQ DEFER INTEREST) indicator to (D)efer. This will ensure that the system does not liquidate the interest on the due date but will simply create a new interest due date according to the frequency component of that field. The amount of interest will consequently be retained within the contract and liquidate on the next interest due date if this flag is set back to 'L'.</p>
            <p>If it is required to receive interest outside these due dates the User should use the MM.RECEIPT.ENTRY facility. This field may be amended at any time during the life of the contract.</p>

            <p>Identifies the interest due date and associated frequency code for Call or Notice contracts.  In Fixed maturity date contracts, the definition of interest due date other than the interest due on MATURITY DATE is handled in field INT.SCHEDULE.</p>
            <p>The interest due date will be changed automatically by the period indicated by the frequency code whenever the date equates to the end-of-day process date.</p>
            <p>Note:  This field is used in conjunction with the Liquidate Or Defer field, where it is further described.</p>
            <p>For special type of accruals, LMM.INSTALL.CONDS field MM.SPEC.INT.METHOD need to be setup. (Refer this field helptext).</p>
            <p>The following are examples of input to this field For Call and Notice contracts:</p>
            <p>a)   31 MAR 1986 M0131 - represents the date from which the frequency is initiated, where:                 M  = month                 01 = at one month intervals                 31 = the last day of the month.</p>
            <p>b)   31 MAR 1986 M0331 - represents a quarterly                 interest due date frequency payable at quarter end.</p>
            <p>Thus, in example a), interest will be liquidated on 31 MAR 1986 and then on 30 APRIL 1986 and so on.  In example b), interest will be liquidated on 31 MAR 1986 and then on 30 JUNE 1986 and so on.</p>

            <p>Input in this field is not allowed for Fixed maturity date contract.</p>
            <p>Where interest is to be paid via a nostro account, the frequency part of this field must be greater than the days delivery of the payment currency. For example, if DEM payments are sent two days prior to their value date (DAYS.DELIVERY field in CURRENCY record DEM has a value of 2), then a DAILY frequency will not be allowed for a DEM Call/Notice deposit that has a nostro account as the interest liquidation account.  For deposits, this is to ensure that payments are not made for future interest periods that have yet to begin. For placements, this is to ensure that 'advice to receives' are not sent for future interest periods that have yet to begin.</p>

(iii)PRIN ADDRESS may be an ACCOUNT WITH Bank (i.e. the final destination of the funds) or it may be an INTERMEDIARY Bank which will pass the funds on to a second bank.  It is only used if no customer ID is available. At contract loading, if the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified in PRIN BEN BANK1, then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be input either directly at PRIN BEN BANK2 or within PRIN ADDRESS in which case the system will automatically apply it to PRIN BEN BANK2. Otherwise, when the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified within PRIN ADDRESS - (and is thus automatically applied to PRIN BEN BANK 1) then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be identified in PRIN BEN BANK2.</p>

            <p>If the actual Principal liquidation account is not entered before the MATURITY DATE, the funds will be applied to a suspense account in the applicable currency and an exception list will be produced for manual handling of the liquidation of the account.</p>
            <p>Another example relating to the use of this suspense account will be the case where a customer requests a more complicated dispersement (separate amounts with different destinations).  Manual handling of the liquidation of the Principal must then be used.</p>
            <p>In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg.

            <p>Note:</p>
            <p>This field is not allowed when the Captalisation or Auto.Captalise is set to 'Y'.</p>

            <p />
            <p>For special type of accruals Install.Conds field MM.SPEC.INT.METHOD need to be setup.(Refer this field helptext).</p>
            <p>The following are examples of input to this field :</p>
            <p />
            <p>a)   31 MAR 2005 M0131 - represents the date from which the frequency is initiated, where:</p>
            <p>M  = month</p>
            <p>01 = at one month intervals</p>
            <p>31 = the last day of the month.</p>
            <p />
            <p>b)   31 MAR 2005 M0331 - represents a quarterly interest due date frequency payable at quarter end.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Thus, in example a), interest will be liquidated on 31 MAR 2005 and then on 30 APRIL 2005 and so on.  In example b), interest will be liquidated on 31 MAR 2005 and then on 30 JUNE 2005 and so on.</p>

            <p />
            <p>(3) Where interest is to be paid via a nostro account, the frequency part of this field must be greater than the days delivery of the payment currency.</p>
            <p>For example, if DEM payments are sent two days prior to their value date (DAYS.DELIVERY field in CURRENCY record DEM has a value of 2), then a DAILY frequency will not be allowed for a DEM deposit that has a nostro account as the interest liquidation account.  For deposits, this is to  ensure that payments are not made for future interest periods that have yet to begin.</p>
            <p>For Loans, this is to ensure that 'advice to receives' are not sent for future interest periods that have yet to begin.</p>

            <p>This field provides flexibility during input of transactions where external movements of funds are involved.  When you do not currently maintain a Customer reference for a third or fourth party bank, you can use this field to enter the full details of the name and address of the Beneficiary Bank directly.</p>
            <p>It is important to note that only one address for the Interest, as free format, has been included in the module.  This means that, in the case of a four party transfer, at least one of the two customer's banks involved in the transfer of funds must have a Customer reference and the AGENCY details defined.</p>

(ii) INT BEN BANK2 may be an ACCOUNT WITH Bank (ie. the final destination of the funds) but may NOT be an INTERMEDIARY bank. (iii)INT ADDRESS may be an ACCOUNT WITH Bank (i.e. the final destination of the funds) or it may be an INTERMEDIARY Bank which will pass the funds on to a second bank.  It is only used if no customer ID is available. At contract loading, if the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified in INT BEN BANK1, then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be input either directly at INT BEN BANK2 or within INT ADDRESS in which case the system will automatically apply it to INT BEN BANK2. Otherwise, when the INTERMEDIARY Bank is identified within INT ADDRESS - (and is thus automatically applied to INT BEN BANK 1) then the ACCOUNT WITH Bank must be identified in INT BEN BANK2.</p>

            <p>Input is only allowed for fixed maturity contracts (i.e. where the final maturity date is an actual date and not simply a number of days as with Call/Notice Contracts). The following values have been defined:-</p>
            <p>1 - Maturity Extension A value of 1 indicates that the maturity date of the contract is to be extended.  No further input is necessary at subsequent fields because the system will simply default the current contract values, should you wish to change the interest rate/spread as well you may do so by inserting the new interest rate and/or at the fields provided. Extending the maturity also extends the interest settlement date, and therefore capitalisation cannot be made.</p>
            <p>2 - Rollover A value of 2 indicates that the contract is to be rolled over at maturity, and such a rollover may be executed in conjunction with AUTO.CAPITALISATION where capitalisation of interest can be made/or not as you require.</p>
            <p>Where the AUTO.CAPITALISATION is set to Yes, the interest amount will be added to the principal. Interest will then be calculated on the Principal plus interest for the next period.</p>
            <p>If set to No, the interest amount will be paid to,or debited from the counterparty (according to the contract type) and rolled Principal only.</p>

<field>CONTRACT.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>Represents the reference number which uniquely identifies a particular contract.</p>
            <p>Every new deal must be automatically assigned a unique contract number which will identify only that deal and no other.  The system maintains a central indicator, on the Company record, which determines whether new Contract numbers are to be automatically generated by the system or whether it is to be input by the User.</p>
            <p>In the case of a Fiduciary Deposit, which automatically generates the corresponding Fiduciary Placement, each of the deals will have separate numbers.  The following is an example of how a Fiduciary Deposit and its corresponding Fiduciary Placement would be numbered:</p>
            <p>MM 85 043 0 0123  =  Fiduciary Deposit MM 85 043 9 0123  =  Fiduciary Placement</p>
            <p>Thus the second contract, which is system generated, is assigned a sequence number in the 90000 range to link it to its corresponding Fiduciary Deposit.</p>

                <p>Validation Rules:</p>

<field>STMT.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>A number generated automatically by the system which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a contract.</p>
            <p>The system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields.</p>
            <p>illustrate the use of this field.</p>
            <p>Example 1:</p>
            <p>On the value date of a contract the following type of number will be generated at this field:</p>
            <p>100.1  STMT.NO ............ 673732684.48            100.2  STMT.NO ............ 1</p>
            <p>The number automatically generated in Field 100.1 is unique to the contract in question and is built in the following way:</p>
            <p>1.         The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of            days since the 1st of January 1968.  In our example,            it corresponds to the 11th of June 1986.</p>
            <p>2.         The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of            seconds since midnight.  In our example, it            corresponds to an entry generated on line at            09:04:44 AM.</p>
            <p>3.         The last two digits '48' indicate the number of            hundreds of seconds.</p>
            <p>The value assigned (again automatically) to Field 100.2 identifies the number in 100.1 as a statement entry number.  If the user wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen the user will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and then type the following at 'AWAITING ID':-            673732684.480001</p>
            <p>where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first statement entry (there may be more than one)</p>

            <p>This field may only be used in conjunction with the INCR EFF DATE field.  When this date is reached, the system will automatically handle all necessary procedures for the increase of principal on the existing contract, together with appropriate re-calculation of the total interest amount due on the contract.</p>
            <p>In addition, it is also possible to enter a back-valued increase or decrease should the need arise.</p>

For this reason a complete set of fields have been included to allow the User, where necessary, to enter manually this information.  The T24 system contains details within the AGENCY file that will be used to determine if there are specific autorouting instructions to ensure delivery to the Beneficiary bank in the specified currency.  If this information does not exist, manual input will be requested.  In the absence of input in this field, the corresponding currency Nostro account will be defaulted.</p>
            <p>If the account through which delivery is to be made is not known, the User can choose to enter one digit (from 1 to 9) which will identify a text (defined in the LMM.TEXT table) to be printed on the confirmation sent to the customer.

The new rate will then be accessed automatically via the INTEREST.KEY from the contract and the revised interest rate (in association with the Interest Spread) will become the effective Interest Rate for calculations. Thus for a large number of existing contracts, with the same basic rate, one rate change on the BASIC.INTEREST table will be sufficient to update, automatically, all those contracts using that Interest Rate key.</p>

<field>INT.RATE.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the type of interest rate to be used for the contract.</p>
            <p>For Money Market operations, the following values are            defined for the interest rate type field:-</p>
            <p>1 = Fixed            3 = Floating            9 = None</p>
            <p>A) FIXED:  The fixed rate applies to those contracts            where the Interest Rate is normally predetermined (ie.            where the rate of interest to be charged over the life of            the contract is fixed at a specific percentage at the            inception of the contract which is often the case for            Money Market transactions).  The Fixed Rate will be            known to both the borrower and the lender at the            inception of the contract.            This type of rate will require the input of the interest            rate inclusive of any possible spread in the field            INTEREST RATE (field 10).</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST KEY and INTEREST SPREAD            (fields 11 and 12) will not be allowed for FIXED INT RATE            TYPE.</p>
            <p>B) FLOATING:  The interest rate on a contract            (Placement or Deposit) is considered as floating when the            rate is liable to change over the life of the contract on            other than a pre-determined schedule of dates.  The rate            of interest on a floating rate contract may be tied to the            Bank's own base rate or it might vary with market rates            or some other specified interest rate.</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST KEY is required since the            Interest Rate will be taken from the Rate table, and            accordingly, no input will be allowed in the INTEREST            RATE field.</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST SPREAD field is allowed and the            Interest Rate will change every time the is a change on            the interest rate table.</p>
            <p>C) NONE: The interest rate is not applicable for the            contract type defined.  This will be the case if the            contract type is Sundry or Account Receivable.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>1 numeric character. Only valid input is 1, 3 or 9. Input is optional; Default value = 1 (i.e. fixed) except for Sundries and Account Receivable where Default = 9. For Fixed Rate Type</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST RATE field is mandatory.</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST KEY and INTEREST SPREAD fields will not be allowed.</p>
            <p>An INTEREST BASIS of Special (S) is allowed (see Interest Rate). For Floating Rate Type</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST KEY field is mandatory.</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST SPREAD field is optional.</p>
            <p>Input in the INTEREST RATE field is not allowed.</p>

If no input is made at this field then the system will default to the country of the counterparty receiving the funds.  However, the situation frequently arises where the counterparty in receipt of placement funds is fully guaranteed in respect of his ability to repay those funds by a different entity (e.g. a parent company) whose residence is in a different country.  Under these circumstances the ultimate risk would be considered to be in the country of the guarantor and the User would therefore wish to insert the code of that country into this field rather than the code of the country of the primary borrower.</p>

            <p>Input can also be made in the format 'Pnn',  'PnnB', 'PnnO' or 'PnnS' where:</p>
            <p>P - signifies that the Periodic Interest Table has to accessed to get the new Interest rate on the Rolled Contract for the New Maturity Date.</p>
            <p>nn - Signifies the Sequence Number on the Periodic Interest Table.</p>

            <p />
            <p>The following values are defined:-</p>
            <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p />
            <p>A = 360/360 -This is the method where each month is considered to have 30 days for the numerator and the denominator will also be 360.</p>

            <p />
            <p>E1 = 365/365 -This is the method where the exact number of  days will be considered in respect of the numerator except the leap year while the denominator will be 365. In the leap year 29th of February month will be ignored.</p>
            <p />
            <p>W = 252/252 -This is the method where the exact number of business days in a year will be considered in respect of the numerator (based on holiday record for LCY) while the denominator will be 252.</p>
            <p />
            <p>W1 = 21/252 -This is the method where each month is considered to have 21 business days( based on holiday record for LCY) for the numerator and the denominator will be 252. ( For more details , refer help Text on System Tables)</p>
            <p />
            <p>F = 360/365.-This is the method where each month is considered to have 30 days for the numerator while the denominator will be on a 365 basis.</p>
            <p />
            <p>S = Special Interest Calculation. Interest calculation method S is applicable if the interest amount is negotiated and does not correspond to any of the other calculation methods e.g. interest for 182.5 days. For M.I.S. and accrual purposes transactions with interest rate calculation method S will be accrued as per the INTEREST.DAY.BASIS of the contract currency, with a compensation in the last period of accruals.</p>
            <p />
            <p>In the options A, B, E, E1, F, W and W1 specified above the number on the left represents the number of days basis for multiplying on the top line of the interest calculation (number of days for which the interest is to be calculated) and the number on the right is the basis for dividing on the bottom line of the interest calculation (number of days in the year).</p>
            <p />
            <p>Where 366 is specified as the left factor, interest will be calculated for the actual number of days in the month.  Where 360 is specified as the left factor, each month will be treated as having 30 days when calculating interest. In months with 31 days, the 31st day is ignored and in February the last day is counted as 3 days, or 2 days in a leap year. Where 365 is specified as the left factor, interest will be calculated for the actual number of days in the month expect the leap </p>
            <p>year. In the leap year 29th of February month is ignored for interest calculations. Where 252 is specified as the left factor, interest will be calculated for the actual number of  business days in the month based on the holiday table for LCY. Where 21( in W1 basis) is specified as the left factor, each month will be treated as 21 business days while calculating the interest. In months with either less or more than 21 business days will be considered as 21 business days based on the holiday table for LCY.</p>
            <p />
            <p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
            <p>To calculate the actual number of days between DATE1 and DATE2, the following rule will be followed when the 30-day basis has been selected:</p>
            <p />
            <p>1) Split DATEn into YEARn, MONTHn and DAYn (where 'n' can vary from 1 to 2).</p>
            <p />
            <p>2) If DAYn = 31, set it to 30 and then perform the following calculations:</p>
            <p />
            <p>a) Subtract YEAR1 from YEAR2 and multiply result by 360. The result will be equal to 'X',</p>
            <p />
            <p>b) Subtract MONTH1 from MONTH2 and multiply result by 30. The result will be equal to 'Y',</p>
            <p />
            <p>c) Subtract DAY1 from DAY2. The result will be equal to 'Z'.</p>
            <p />
            <p>3) Add 'X' + 'Y' + 'Z' together to find the number of days between the two dates.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example for 360 Method:</p>

<field>MERGE.CONTRACT</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field caters for customers who wish to merge several contracts of the same type with the same maturity into one contract by having one contract roll over (the primary contract) at maturity and applying a  principal increase for the total of the principal and/or  interest to be transferred from the maturing (secondary) contracts.</p>
            <p>It is also possible to perform a normal principal increase on rollover on the primary contract in this case the actual increase applied will be the total of the principal increase, the merged amounts plus any interest to be capitalised from the primary contract.</p>
            <p>Additional principal increase accounting entries will be generated for the total of the merged amounts.</p>
            <p>Merging will take place via a Suspense account which should be set up via the ACCOUNT.CLASS record MERGEMM.</p>
            <p>For example in the case merged deposits the secondary contracts will have the principal and/or interest liquidation accounts set to the merge suspense account for the relevant currency. When the contract matures the suspense account will be credited. When the amounts are merged into the primary contract the suspense account will be debited.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>To merge contracts the following conditions must apply.  Fields which should have the same values :-  COUNTERPARTY  CURRENCY  CATEGORY  Conditions which must apply to this (Primary) contract. ==========================================  Must be set for either manual or auto rollover.  Cannot be set to merge to another contract.  The PRIN.LIQ.ACCT and INT.LIQ.ACCT cannot be set to the merge suspense account.  If AUTO.ROLLOVER is set with a FINAL.MATURITY  to indicate that multiple interest payments take place, then this  contract must be within the final interest period.  Conditions which must apply to the merge (secondary) contracts ==================================================  Cannot be set to Manually rollover.  The PRIN.LIQ.ACCT and/or  INT.LIQ.ACCT fields must be set to the merge suspense account.  If AUTO.ROLLOVER is set with a FINAL.MATURITY  to indicate that multiple interest payments take place, then the merge contract must be within the final interest period, in this case the FINAL.MATURITY date of the secondary contract must be equal to the INT.PERIOD.END date of the primary contract.  If the merge (secondary) contract is set for a single interest period then the MATURITY.DATE of the secondary contract  must be equal to the INT.PERIOD.END date of the primary contract.  If both the secondary and the primary contracts are set for a single interest payment then the MATURITY.DATE of the secondary contract must be equal to the MATURITY.DATE of the primary contract.</p>

<field>INTEREST.SPREAD.1</field>
<desc>
            <p>The spread entered here is a modifier of the interest rate derived from either the value in INTEREST KEY, or for contracts that are being rolled over using the auto-rollover mechanism (using rates from tables). It is not used as a modifier for standard fixed rate contracts that have not been rolled over.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>Where the INT.RATE.TYPE is 3 (Floating) the Interest rate is derived from the relevant BASIC.INTEREST key. This rate can be modified at contract level by using a positive or negative spread to increase/reduce the derived rate.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>Contracts having the AUTO.ROLLOVER fields set, and requiring the interest rates for the subsequent periods to be derived from rate tables can also use this field to modify the interest rate. This is by using the field ROLLOVER.INT.RATE with a value such as</p>

            <p />
            <p>The derived interest rate (INTEREST KEY + OR - INTEREST SPREAD) must be greater than '0'. If, due to basic interest rate changes, the accrual process identifies a derived rate which is equal to or less than '0' a warning message is written to the exception report and no accrual is performed. Manual action is then required the following day to reset the rate to a positive value where upon previous accruals will be recovered at the next appropriate accrual run.</p>

<field>SWIFT.COMMON.REF</field>
<desc>
            <p>This is an internal field which is automatically generated by the system when the counterparty has a SWIFT address defined on the Agency file.  This common reference will be used on all messages transmitted through SWIFT.</p>
            <p>The common reference consists of the SWIFT confirmation address codes of the two counterparties, i.e. ourselves and the counterparty of the transaction.  These codes will appear in alphabetical order.  From the counterparty SWIFT confirmation address specified in the Agency file, the system will automatically select the first four digits plus the seventh and eighth digit.</p>
            <p>The two codes are separated by the four least significant figures from the interest rate on the contract and these are right justified with leading zeros added, if needed, to ensure that four figures are shown.</p>
            <p>Rate               Shown as            2.4560             2456            0.2450             0245            0.2400             0024            24.000             0024            24.125             4125</p>
            <p>Thus for a Money Market deal between ourselves with SWIFT confirmation address ABCDEF and a counterparty with SWIFT address STUVWXYZ at an agreed interest rate of, say, 15.75% then the Swift Common Reference would be constructed as follows:-</p>
            <p>ABCDEF1575STUVYZ</p>
            <p>The system will then display the above reference at this field and it would be used on all SWIFT message types relating to this contract and on all the entries generated by Accounting.</p>
            <p>It should be noted that if the deal has no interest rate (a Sundry deposit or an account receivable) then '0000' is used as the interest portion of this field.</p>
            <p>If the counterparty of the deal does not have a SWIFT address on its Agency record (or indeed does not have an Agency record) then no reference is computed and this field is completed with the word 'NONE'.</p>

<field>TAX.INTEREST.KEY</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indentifies the Code from the Tax Table when the Interest on a Deposit transaction is subject to Taxes.</p>
            <p>Local taxes may be applicable in the case of Deposits as defined within the Money Market Module.  Such taxes will be withheld by the Bank from the total interest amount and only the net amount of interest will be paid to the customer.  For this reason the Payment Function (see later in this documentation) will always show the net amount of interest to be paid.</p>
            <p>A special Tax Table has been included in the T24 system where the User may define the tax conditions (local and withholding tax) applicable to his country.  This table is described elsewhere in this documentation and provides a better understanding of the tax routine.</p>
            <p>Any tax applicable to a Deposit will be entered here in the form of a tax key by means of which the system will refer to the tax table where the User will have already set up his range of tax classifications.  All tax codes and conditions for taxes will therefore be defined in the tax table.</p>
            <p>In the case of interest due on a Deposit transaction taxes will be deducted from the total interest amount on the actual payment date and the customer will thus receive the net amount due.</p>
            <p>Reference to the Tax Table documentation will provide a more detailed description of the Tax Table facilities.</p>
            <p>This field can be defaulted if the TAX.INTEREST.TYPE field is used. See the helptext for CONTRACT.GRP and TAX.INTEREST.TYPE for further information.</p>
            <p>Note:      It is always the TAX rate applicable as of the interest            payment date which will be taken to calculate the Tax            amount.</p>

            <p>The system will check that the Tax Code is present on the Tax Table and also that it refers to local taxes (01).  Any valid existing key will be accepted but for key(s) with multiple tax rates, only the first tax rate of the key will be taken into consideration for the tax amount calculation.</p>

            <p>The customer may request delivery of funds either within the Bank (when the Customer actually maintains an account relationship with the Bank) or externally at another bank. Thus the User could need to enter appropriate information in the fields existing for this purpose (see Payment fields). The T24 System contains details within the SEC.ACC.MASTER file found through using the Portfolio number. If no default account is found the CUSTOMER.CCY.ACCT record is read for the customer. If no account is found, the details within the AGENCY file will be used to determine if there are specific auto-routing instructions to ensure delivery to the Beneficiary Customer in the specified currency. If this information does not exist, manual input will be requested.</p>
            <p>If the account, through which delivery is to be made, is not known the User can choose to enter one digit (from 1 to 9) which will identify a text (defined in text file with title LMM.TEXT) to be printed on the confirmation sent to the customer. This will also result in the funds being applied to a suspense account in the applicable currency.</p>
            <p>In case the underlying Contract Customer (eg.
