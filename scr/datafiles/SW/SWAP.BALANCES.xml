<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The SWAP.BALANCES file records all financial movements and balance details of a particular Swap contract (including all balance information, principal outstanding, accruals, interest paid/received, rate changes, etc.).</p>
            <p>Both current and historical details are maintained providing a means by which the system can control and record all financial transactions.</p>
            <p>This file also provides a valuable source of information for enquiry and reporting purposes for both bank and customer requirements.</p>
            <p>The file is keyed by contract number and leg identifier (asset or liability).</p>
            <p>Two SWAP.BALANCES records, Asset and Liability, are created whenever a Swap contract is entered into the system and remain there as long as the contract remains "Live". Eg. SW9503000001.A and SW9503000001.L</p>
            <p>The file is updated automatically by any Swap routines which modify any balance details.  There is no facility for direct input to this file.  The only functions that users are allowed to perform are "L"ist, "S"ee, and "P"rint.</p>
            <p>A corresponding save file and history file exist, namely SWAP.BALANCES.SAVE and SWAP.BALANCES.HIST, which will be a copy of the data held in the SWAP.BALANCES file. The save file stores the last authorised version of the balances record whereas the history file stores the reversed version.</p>
            <p>Whenever a Swap schedule is processed on the Swap contract, it is removed from the contract and it's details held on the relevant SWAP.BALANCES record.</p>
            <p>The following associated information is held on this file :</p>
            <p>o  Currency of the leg.   o  Indication as to whether the principal is NOTIONAL or not.   o  Outstanding principal details.   o  Effective and historical interest rates.   o  Interest amounts and accrual details.   o  Amortisation details.   o  Schedules processed details.   o  Corresponding CRB details.</p>

            <p>The set of fields ACCR.FROM.DATE to MKT.ACT.AMT form the multivalue set of interest accrual fields. These fields record all details of interest accrued on the swap leg.</p>
            <p />
            <p>This field records the market exchange amount of interest accrued for each of the multivalue accrual groups. This amount is unrounded. The rounded accrued amount is held in the associated field MKT.ACCR.AMT.</p>

<field>PRIN.DATE</field>

            <p>Stores the dates on which the principal balance amounts in the field PRINCIPAL became effective.</p>
            <p>Whenever the principal balance for the leg on the contract changes, the new balance is recorded in the associated PRINCIPAL field.  The PRIN.DATE field records the date on which each of these balances became effective.</p>
            <p>Information is stored in these fields in reverse chronological order, ie. the most recent effective date will always be found in the first multivalue.</p>
            <p>This field is a no-input field and is automatically updated by the Swaps system.</p>

            <p>This field therefore consists of a number of multivalues, each recording the interest key applicable to the associated leg at various times throughout the life of the contract.  The date on which each interest key was effective is stored in the associated multivalue of the EFFECTIVE.DATE field.</p>
