            <p>This file defines all the schedules which are permitted on a Swap contract. </p>
            <p>All schedules are defined on the contract for both legs, Asset (AS.TYPE) and Liability (LB.TYPE). </p>
            <p>The first two characters of the Id of the record determine the type of schedules and are fixed as follows : </p>
            <p>  o  AC  Interest accrual current month   o  AM  Interest accrual previous month   o  AY  Interest accrual previous year   o  CI  Contract initiation (contingent movements)   o  CM  Contract maturity   o  PX  Principal exchange   o  RX  Principal re-exchange   o  PI  Principal increase   o  PD  Principal decrease   o  IP  Interest payment   o  RR  Rate reset   o  PM  Payment (premium, interest purchased etc.)   o  RV  Receipt (premium, interest received etc.)   o  IS  Issue price   o  AP  Annuity payment </p>
            <p>Different schedules can be defined but the first two characters must be one of the above.  Eg.  "PMPR" = Payment of Premium. </p>
            <p>The following schedule types are system generated schedules and cannot be defined on the contract by the user : </p>
            <p>  o  AC  Accrual current month   o  AM  Accrual previous month   o  AY  Accrual previous year   o  CI  Contract initiation   o  CM  Contract maturity </p>
            <p>For each schedule defined, the following associated information is also held : </p>
            <p>  o  Transaction code (Mandatory except CI,CM,RR; must be unique if IS)   o  Profit &amp; Loss Category code (Mandatory if PM,RV,IS)   o  Charge code   o  Fee code   o  Enrichment description. </p>
