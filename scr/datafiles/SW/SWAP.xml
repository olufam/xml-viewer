            <p>This is the main Swap contract file.</p>
            <p>The details supporting the swap transaction will be held on a single contract. A Swap contract consists of two legs, Asset and Liability, both of which are maintained on the contract. It stores details of the counterparty of the swap, the notional principal(s), rates, schedules for both swap legs, payment instructions etc. A swap contract is an agreement to exchange interest payments in a fixed obligation for interest payments in a floating rate obligation (Interest Rate Swap), or one currency for another (Currency Swap), and reverse the exchange at a later date.</p>
            <p>An Interest Rate Swap (IRS) contract is a contract in which two counterparties agree to exchange interest payments of differing character based on an underlying notional principal amount that is never exchanged.</p>
            <p>In a Currency Interest Rate Swap (CIRS) contract the underlying principal amount is usually real (not notional) and is usually exchanged (Principal Exchange PX and Principal Re-exchange RX schedules).</p>
            <p>Typically, a swap contract exchanges fixed rate obligations for a floating rate instrument in the same currency for an IRS contract and different currencies for a CIRS contract.</p>
            <p>In its simplest form, the two parties to an Interest Rate Swap exchange the interest payment obligations (IRS - no principal changes hands, CIRS - principal changes hands) on two different kinds of debt instruments, one being a fixed interest rate, the other being a floating rate.</p>
            <p>The following are examples of Interest Swaps :</p>
            <p />
            <p>Coupon swap or exchange of fixed rate for floating rate instruments in the same currency</p>
            <p>Basis swaps or the exchange of floating rate to floating rate instruments in the same     currency.</p>
            <p>Cross currency interest rate swaps involving the exchange of fixed rate instruments in     one currency for floating rate in another.</p>
            <p>Exchange of floating rate to floating rate instruments in different currencies.</p>
            <p>For example : (See Figure Below)</p>
            <p />
            <p>Notional Amount : $10 Million</p>
            <p>Maturity: 5 Years</p>
            <p>Payment Freq. : Both fixed and floating rate payments made semi-annually.</p>
            <p>A Foreign Exchange (FOREX) swap differs from an Interest Rate Swap (See Foreign Exchange module for more information on FOREX swaps). A Foreign Exchange swap contract within the FOREX application is the simultaneous buying and selling of a currency in approximately equal amounts for different maturity dates. The swap price is the difference in price between the two maturity dates of the swap.</p>

<field>CONTRACT.NUMBER</field>
<desc>
            <p>A unique reference number which identifies a particular Swap contract.</p>
            <p>Contract numbers can be generated either manually or automatically. Where automatic generation is supported depression of the F3 key at the "Awaiting ID" prompt supplies the next available contract number.</p>
            <p>To avoid the necessity to manually input the complete reference number (contract number), the User has the facility to input only the sequence number of the transaction which has been input that day. The Application will automatically generate the seven first digits and append them to the front of the sequence number in order to retrieve the requested transaction. Access to any Swap transaction from a previous day requires the input of the corresponding julian day and year if the contract has been done in a previous year.</p>
            <p>The reference has the following format SWyydddnnnnn, where :</p>
            <p>o SW = Application indicator for the Swaps application. o yy = The last two digits of the year when the transaction is processed. o ddd = Julian day number within the year when the Swap transaction is processed. o nnnnn = Five digit sequential number.</p>
            <p>The above numbering convention enables 99,999 deals to be struck on any one day.</p>
            <p>When a deal is to be confirmed (using the Verify function) the type of confirmation (either customer or broker) may be defined by prefixing either CU (for customer confirmations) or BR (for broker confirmations) to the contract number of the deal to be confirmed. If this prefix is missing and the deal is to be verified the user will be requested to specify which type of confirmation is required. Once the prefix is chosen it remains the same until changed (i.e. the prefix can be specified once and then omitted for subsequent contracts).</p>
            <p>Certain versions will automatically append the BR or CU prefix to the contract number. If the prefix BR or CU is present during any other function it will be removed from the contract number and will have no effect on the processing of the contract.</p>

<desc>
 <p>Part of Regulatory Reporting information to a Trade Repository</p>     
 <p>All Trades should have a Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) which is generated, communicated and matched</p>
 <p>Determination of who generates the UTI should follow the existing industry best practices for that Asset class</p>
 <p>The UTI.USI.API attached in OC.PARAMETER and invoked during FRA deal capture determines who is the party responsible for UTI generation and does the following.</p>
<p>•	If a value is present during deal capture the API is not invoked, on the assumption that the UTI is generated and supplied by the other Counterparty.</p>
<p>•	If no value is present during the deal capture, the API is invoked to determine the party responsible for generating the UTI. If the Other counterparty is responsible, still an UTI is generated with a suffix as TEMP to show that the UTI from the other counterparty is awaited and in the meantime, the reporting is done with a Temporary ID. If T24 Bank is responsible for UTI generation, then the same is generated without TEMP.</p> 
<p>•	Where a reporting has been made with UTI having TEMP as suffix and subsequently the Counterparty supplies the UTI, the following procedure has to be followed to ensure reporting with actual UTI.</p>
<p>•	The field Action Type needs to be changed to ‘E’ and record to be authorized. Later, the UTI field should be modified with the actual UTI received. Set the Action Type field to ‘N’ and authorize the record. In this way, the previous reporting gets cancelled and the new reporting goes with correct UTI. </p>
 <p> Input to this field is allowed only when OC module is installed. </p>

	 <p> N denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is NEW. Value of 'N' is defaulted for a new contract. User is also allowed to change the status to N if the previous status is E. </p>
	 <p> E denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is REVERSE or Correction. In case of wrongly entered UTI values or a Temporary UTI was used previously, the old UTI should be reported with ACTION.TYPE as 'E' for error reporting first and then change the Action Type to NEW after keying in the actual UTI. This way the previous reporting with temporary UTI is replaced by the one with final UTI. Action Type ‘E’ is also used to undo the reporting of a particular transaction done which should not have been done reported at all in the first instance.</p>
	<p> M denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is MODIFIED. In case of change in the RATE.FIXING.DATE the ACTION.TYPE is set to 'M'.</p>
<p> C denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is CANCELLED. In case of any change in maturity/value date i.e. early termination of the contract should be reported with C. In FRA this MATURITY.DATE field is No change field. So ACTION.TYPE never gets populated automatically with type as C but It can be manually updated as ‘c’ and the contract can be cancelled. </p> 
<p> Z denotes Compression update. This means the trade being reported is generated out of a compression activity. </p>
