<field>NPV.FWD.RATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates whether the system has to use the Future interest rates for calculation of  Future Interest payment amounts for NPV processing.</p>

            <p>This field accepts input of YES, NO or NONE.</p>
            <p>Default value is NONE. No and NONE mean the same.</p>
            <p>If set to yes, System will use the formula to arrive at the Future Interest Rates  for calculating the Future Interest Payments for the purpose of  valuation of the Swap. For more information, please refer to User Guide on Interest Rate Swaps.</p>

<field>NPV.ACCR.ADJ</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies whether the accrual amount has to  be calculated by the system or to be referred from swap balances for adjusting with NPV amount during valuation and system does not calculate the NPV for current IP on the last day of the accrual period.</p>
            <p>Values allowed are YES, NO or NONE. Default value is NONE</p>
            <p>When set to YES, the accrual amount that has to be adjusted with NPV amount will be referred from ACCR.AMT field of SWAP.BALANCES. The NPV becomes zero for the current IP on the last day of the accrual period.</p>
            <p>When set to NO or NONE, system calculates the accrual amount that has to adjusted with NPV amount based on current IP period</p>

<field>SPL.NPV.PROCESS</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the special NPV revaluation methodology in which the Interest payment amount will be included for the valuation on the interest payment date.</p>
            <p>Value allowed are YES, NO or NONE. Default value is NONE</p>
            <p />
            <p>A value of YES can be set only if :</p>

            <p>b) NPV.ACCR.ADJ is set to NO or NONE</p>
            <p />
            <p>When set to YES,</p>
            <p />
            <p>The core swap module will not raise any entries for interest accrual and NPV valuation but the same will be handled by IA module based on client requirements. This is applicable to SWAP deals set with a Revaluation Type.</p>
            <p>The interest payment due on that date of revaluation will also be considered for net present valuation.</p>
            <p>Since accrual entries are suppressed, the entries relating to IP payment will be raised between the Profit and Loss (P&amp;L) and Customer/Nostro/Internal accounts</p>
            <p />
            <p>When set to NO or NONE, the core swap module will raise entries for interest accrual and revaluation amount (if revaluation is applicable) and exclude the Interest payment amount during revaluation on the interest payment date.</p>

<field>IMP.FUT.RATE.API</field>

            <p>User can attach an user defined routine to include any margin in to the derived future rate for the future interest payments during valuation.</p>
            <p>Routine can be attached only when the field NPV.FWD.RATE is set to YES.</p>
            <p>The routine should have a valid entry in PGM.FILE.</p>
            <p>The attached routine will be triggered for the floating leg contracts involving local currency.</p>
            <p>The attached routine accepts the following parameters </p>
            <p>1.    Swap contract in the form of array </p>
            <p>2.    Swap balances in the form of array</p>

            <p>8.    Leg currency</p>
            <p>9.    Forward Rate as derived by the system for the future Interest payment.</p>
            <p />
            <p>User can include margin to the forward rate based on their requirements. System further considers this modified rate and applies spread  (if applicable) on it and will take the resultant rate for processing. </p>
            <p />
            <p>User can only modify the forward rate as part of the routine, amendments to other parameters are not allowed; if done, it will not be reflected in the system. </p>

<field>ZERO.COUPON.RATE</field>

            <p>Indicates how the discounting rates are to be used for net present valuation.</p>
            <p>Values allowed are YES, NO, ALT, NONE. Default value is NONE</p>
            <p>If set to NO, system does not perform bootstrapping to arrive at the zero coupon rate, it rather uses the rate from PI table directly.</p>
            <p>If set to YES or ALT, system does bootstrapping to arrive at the zero coupon rate.</p>
            <p>If set to YES or NONE,</p>
            <p>The net present value of the future cash flows for the particular period will be discounted by Zero Coupon Rate which is based on the previous period's Coupon Rate(S).</p>
            <p>If set to ALT,</p>
            <p>The net present value of the future cash flows for the particular period will be discounted by Zero Coupon Rate which is based on the previous period's Zero Coupon Rate(S).</p>
