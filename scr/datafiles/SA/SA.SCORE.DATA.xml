The score models or score cards could vary based on the product. The data to be collected could therefore vary product wise. It is possible to define the data required for credit scoring product wise in SA.SCORE.DATA. 
The ID of the record could be free text. The data required for credit scoring can be defined as a data type, data group or a ratio

            <p>Credit scoring can be based on data types (like age, occupation etc.,), data groups (like total income etc.,) and ratios (like Loan to Value, Debt to Income etc.,).  This field Indicates the data group that are required for credit scoring for a particular product. Score need not be assigned directly based on a data group. But if the data groups are required in calculating a  ratio that forms a part of the scoring, the same must be included. Multi value field to define as many data groups as required.</p>
