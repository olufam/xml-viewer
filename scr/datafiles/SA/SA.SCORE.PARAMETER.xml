            <p>It is possible that the bank would like to have different score card for the same product based on certain attributes of the applicant. For a corporate loan product, for example, it is possible to have different score card by industry. Similarly for a mortgage loan the score card could differ by residential status. </p>
            <p>In order to define different score cards for the same product (as defined in SA.SCORE.DATA) facility exists in this parameter file to link to one of customer attributes. The customer attributes are stored in CUSTOMER table. Hence by linking the SA.SCORE.DATA ID to any field (that is not a multi value field) in CUSTOMER table it is possible to have different IDs for score card.</p>
            <p>For example, if different score cards are required for corporate loan product based on the industry, then the parameter file could be defined as under;</p>
            <p />
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Field Name</td>
                    <td>Value</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>SCORE.CARD</td>
                    <td>CORPORATE.LOAN (ID in SA.SCORE.DATA)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>SCORE.BY.TABLE</td>
                    <td>CUSTOMER</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>SCORE.BY.FIELD</td>
                    <td>INDUSTRY</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>By the above definition, it is possible to have different score cards for corporate loan product by industry. Thus score cards with ID CORPORATE.LOAN-1100 (for manufacturing industry), CORPORATE.LOAN-1200 (Pharma Industry) etc., can be defined. the values 1100 and 1200 must be valid records in INDUSTRY table. As of now it is possible to link to any field in CUSTOMER table only. </p>
            <p>It is also possible to parameterise the number of days the system should retain the score transaction before moving to history.</p>
