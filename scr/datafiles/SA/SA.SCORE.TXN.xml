            <p>
This table would be used to record the actual values against each data type. System would calculate data group values, ratios, score and assign exposure levels (limits) to the borrower.

The data required to be captured could be indicated by selecting the appropriate ID of SA.SCORE.DATA (loan product ID). Based on this system would default the data types/data groups required to be captured, ratios to be calculated. Once the actual values are input and  PERFORM.CALC is set to YES, system would do the credit scoring by choosing the appropriate score card and assign a limit.

Score card selection for credit scoring would be based on the following rules;

1) If there exists only one score card for the product then it would used for scoring

2) If there exists multiple score cards for a product based on certain customer attribute (as defined in parameter file), system would try to match the customer's attribute with the relevant score card, else, score card defined at product level would be used for credit scoring.

If the limit is granted in foreign currency, the currency of the limit and the exchange rate that is to be reckoned may also be defined.

<field>ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>A unique reference number which identifies a particular contract.

Contract numbers can be generated either a) manually or b) automatically. For automatic generation the appropriate indicator must be set by the system supervisor. Where automatic generation is supported depression of the F3 key at the "Awaiting ID" prompt supplies the next contract number.

In instances where manual number generation is followed, the sequence number is the only mandatory data element. The system will supply the remainder based on the current application date.
