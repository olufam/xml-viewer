            <p>
Scorecards could be defined in the table SA.SCORE.CARD. The ID of the record would be the same as SA.SCORE.DATA or ID of SA.SCORE.DATA : any allowed value in the linked field of CUSTOMER table (as defined in parameter file). Thus for a mortgage loan product, the ID of SA.SCORE.CARD could be MORTGAGE (as defined in SA.SCORE.DATA) or MORTGAGE-US (if separate score card is to be defined for US residents). Similarly for corporate loan product scorecard could be defined for corporate loan in general with ID as CORP.LOAN or CORP.LOAN-MFG (if separate score card is to defined for manufacturing industry).

The individual scores for each of the data can be defined in score card. Flexibility has been provided to define the score based on a data type, data group and or ratio. It is also possible to have a score based two or more data together.

For sample definitions of score card please refer to USER GUIDE.</p>

            <p>The operand to decide whether ONE or ALL of the multiple conditions stipulated are to be satisfied for the rule to apply.

OR - One of the conditions should satisfy

ALL - All the conditions are to be satisfied

Example (a) - A score of 10 points is given if either ratio ABC is less than 1 or ratio CBA is less than 5. The definition in this case will be as follows;

2.1       Operand                OR
3.1.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.1.1    Decision                LT
5.1.1    Decision fr            1.00
6.1.1    Decision to               
3.1.2    Ratio.Type            CBA
4.1.2    Decision                LT
5.1.2    Decision fr            5.00
6.1.2    Decision to               
7.1       FS.Score                10

Example (b)  - A score of 15 is applicable if ratio DEF value is less than 1 and ABC ratio value is less than 2. In this case, the definition is as follows;

2.1       Operand               AND
3.1.1    Ratio.Type            DEF 
4.1.1    Decision                LT
5.1.1    Decision fr            1.00
6.1.1    Decision to               
3.1.2    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.1.2    Decision                LT
5.1.2    Decision fr            2.00
6.1.2    Decision to              
7.1       FS.Score                15

Note that if multiple conditions are satisfied, the scores for each satisfied set will be reckoned and hence care should be exercised in defining the rule.

Example (c) - If value of ratio ABC is less than 1 the points are 10, for value 1-1.99 the points are 15, for value 2-2.99 the points are 20 and for value greater than or equal to 3 the points are 25. In this case the definition should be as follows;

2.1       Operand                OR
3.1.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.1.1    Decision                LT

4.2.1    Decision                RG
5.2.1    Decision fr            1.00
6.2.1    Decision to            1.99   
7.2        FS.Score                15
2.3       Operand                OR
3.3.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.3.1    Decision                RG
5.3.1    Decision fr            2.00
6.3.1    Decision to            2.99   
7.3      FS.Score                20
2.4       Operand                OR
3.4.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.4.1    Decision                GE
5.4.1    Decision fr            3.00
6.4.1    Decision to               
7.4       FS.Score                25

In the above case if the actual score is say 2.75 only one condition is satisfied (set 3) and hence 20 points are given.

However, if the definition is as follows for the same rule (this is an incorrect definition and should NOT be made)

2.1       Operand                OR
3.1.1    Ratio.Type            ABC

3.3.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.3.1    Decision                LT
5.3.1    Decision fr            3.00
6.3.1    Decision to               
7.3    FS.Score                 20
2.4       Operand                OR
3.4.1    Ratio.Type            ABC
4.4.1    Decision                GE
5.4.1    Decision fr            3.00
6.4.1    Decision to               
7.4       FS.Score                25

In this case if the value of the calculated ration is say 0.90, conditions 1, 2 and 3 are satisfied and hence 10+15+20 = 45 points will be given.
