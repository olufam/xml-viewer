<field>ZERO.CHECK</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies if this data type should be considered for zero check. For corporate clients it would be required to ensure the data integrity of balance sheet details. In such cases the sum of asset data types must equal the sum of liability data types. It is possible to classify a data type as asset or liability and include for Zero Check. When the actual values are input at the time of scoring, system would group all the asset data types and liability data types. It would then compare the difference and store in the scoring transaction file. </p>

        <p>DATA.TYPE</p>
        <p>This field is used to store the characteristic of the data type. For example a data type AGE could be a numeric value, data type OCCUPATION LEVEL could be an alphanumeric value. Care should be taken while defining the characteristics of the data type. Ideally it should be the same as the values collected in the loan application form or at subsequent stages. System would validate the scoring rules against this data characteristics. For example if data type AGE is defined as NUMERIC, system would check if the scoring rules defined for AGE is based on numeric values. Similarly, when values for an applicant are entered against each data type, system would check if the input data is in conformity to the data characteristics defined here. In the above example system would not accept values such as 'ABC' against AGE as it has been defined as NUMERIC. </p>
        <p>Validation Rules</p>
        <p> Allowed input are ALPHA, ALPHANUMERIC, AMOUNT, NUMERIC, RATE and DATE.</p>
