            <p>The data types defined in SA.DATA.TYPES would be the lowest level data. At times scoring models or score cards would require data that is a sum of low-level data. For example score card may require TOTAL INCOME as one of the data. However, the bank may collect details such as MONTHLY INCOME, BONUS, OTHER INCOME etc., separately.  To facilitate such scenarios it is possible to group a set of like data types.</p>
