            <p>SEAT means System Engineering Automated Testing.It is is available for testing both technical and functional aspects of T24.The overall objective is to build an Automated Testing System is that,which helps to manage the testing inputs (Scripts) and Evaluate the test results by:</p>
            <p />
            <p> Setting-up and managing a library of Test Cases (SEAT Scripts) which can be injected on every T24 build (any shipment from System Engineering).</p>
            <p> And</p>
            <p> Call test routines (on the technical infrastructure available from SEAT) to evaluate the results for each transaction generated out of SEAT scripts. These test routines would be self assessing (checks the test results and updates exceptions in a file)</p>
