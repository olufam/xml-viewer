            <p>REG.FILES.SUMMARY is an LIVE template, which gives the complete details about the all the files avaliable in 
the System. It specifies the details like Number of Reads,  Number of Updates(Writes/Delets), happened in
 the file and also gives the details like Application, Routine and Function by which the file is updated.</p>

<field>READ.APP.PROGRAM</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field gives the details of the Application, and function during which the file is read. In addition to Application and Function, 
it also specifies the routine by which the read is happened.</p>
            <p> Any Alphanumeric characters are allowed.</p>
            <p>This field will hold the application and routines names in the following format.</p>

<field>TOTAL.UPDATES</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field specifies the total number of updates/writes happened in the file specified in the record ID. 
This field is count is increased by one, whenever the update(writes/deletes) happens in the file.I.e., this field value
 is the summation of the multi value fields NO.OF.WRITES, NO.OF.DELETES</p>
            <p>This field allows Numeric Input or Specified Input by Table</p>
        </desc>
</t>
<t>
<field>TOTAL.READS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field specifies the total number of reads happened in the file specified in the record ID. This field count is increased by one,
 when ever the file is read across applications and routines.I.e The TOTAL.READS field count is the summation of the multi value
 field NO.OF.READS</p>
            <p>This field allows Numeric Input or Specified Input by Table.</p>

<field>WRITE.APP.PROGRAM</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field gives the details of the Application, and function during which the file is updated/written. In addition to Application and Function, 
it also specifies the routine by which the updates/writes is happened</p>
            <p>Any Alphanumeric characters are allowed.</p>
            <p>This field will hold the application and routines names in the following format.</p>
            <p>FILE.APPLICATION*ROUTINE.NAME*SR.FUNCTION</p>
            <p> E.g, SECURITY.MASTER*OS.CREATE.TOKEN*I</p>

<field>PROD.FILE.NAME</field>
<desc>
            <p>This is the unique ID to identify the record created under this file.Any alphanumeric characters are allowed.</p>
            <p>The ID of the Regression files summary file is the combination of Product name and file name</p>

<field>DELETE.PROGRAMS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field gives the details of the Application, and function by which the file is deleted. In addition to Application and Function, 
it also specifies the routine by which the deletes is done</p>
            <p>Any Alphanumeric characters are allowed.</p>
            <p>This field will hold the application and routines names in the following format.</p>

<field>NO.OF.DELETES</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field counts the number of deletes happened in the file by specified routine called in the application.This field count
 is incremented based on the value in DELETE.PROGRAMS field.That is, when ever the deletes happens in the file(specified in the record ID),
the name of the Application and its correspoding function during which the routine does a deletes is checked in the field DELETE.PROGRAMS,
 of the  record already stored in Reg files summary application. Based on that value, the field NO.OF.DELETES is incremented by one. </p>
            <p>This field allows Numeric Input or Specified Input by Table.</p>

<field>NO.OF.READS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field counts the number of reads happened in the file by specified routine called in the application.This field count
 is incremented based on the value in READ.APP.PROGRAM field.That is, when ever the read happens in the file(specified in the record ID),
the name of the Application and its correspoding function during which the routine does a read is checked in the field READ.APP.PROGRAM, 
of the  record already stored in Reg files summary application. Based on that value, the field NO.OF.READS is incremented by one. </p>
