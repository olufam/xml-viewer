<table>SCRIPT.REPOSITORY.INTERFACE</table>
</header>
<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>The interface can be used to upload scripts from User Area to Script Repository or to download scripts from Script Repository to User Area. Repository is stored in a designated area in server 24 (grepos), which is hard coded.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   The upload/download involves two activities:</p>
            <p>   SELECTION ACTIVITIY</p>
            <p>   1. To be executed (by Verifying a user defined record) in the user Area for Upload</p>
            <p>   2. To be executed (by Verifying a user defined record) in the Repository for Download</p>
            <p />
            <p>   UPDATE ACTIVITY:</p>
            <p>   1. To be executed (by Verifying a user defined record) in the Repository for Upload</p>
            <p>   2. To be executed (by Verifying a user defined record) in the User Area for Download</p>
            <p />
            <p>   For Uploading Scripts:</p>
            <p>   1. Complete the Selection Activity for upload in User Area. This will select the records and transfer them to an outside folder in Repository (grepos)</p>
            <p>   2. Log in to the Repository with the same user/password and complete the Update Activity for upload. This will transfer the contents of the folder to the intended files.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   For Downloading Scripts:</p>
            <p>   1. Complete the Selection Activity for download in Repository (grepos). This will select the records and transfer them to an outside folder in User Area</p>
            <p>   2. Log in to the User Area with the same user/password and complete the Update Activity for download. This will transfer the contents of the folder to the intended files.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   As users can upload stand alone records in SEAT.SCRIPTS, SEAT.SCRIPT.ACTIVITY, SEAT.SCRIPT.RESULT.FILES, SEAT.SCRIPT.FIELD.VALUES and SEAT.SCRIPT.FORMAT.OUTPUT  alone, any linkages between them need to be ensured by them for correct uploading of scripts and for checking results.</p>
