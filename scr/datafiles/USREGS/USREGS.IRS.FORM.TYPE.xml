		<field>MAP.FILE</field>
		<desc>
			<p>The underlying file from which the data of the fields are to be referenced for mapping the ID for the tax table are defined here.</p>

		<field>SYSTEM.ID</field>
		<desc>
			<p>This field will have the EB.SYSTEM.ID of the transaction. </p>
			<p>This is an optional field and need to be defined only if different mapping of ID fields are to be done depending on the main application.</p>
			<p>EX: If the ID of Tax reporting  contains the loan reference then the TXN.REFERENCE can be directly mapped for EB.SYSTEM.ID “LD”  for STMT.ENTRY raised  from LD.LOANS.AND.DEPOSITS </p>
			<p>In case of STMT.ENTRY raised from PD.PAYMENT.DUE   only part of the TXN.REFERENCE need to be mapped to get the loan reference.</p>
			<p>Hence this can be achieved  by the combination of SYSTEM.ID as “PD“and ID.STMT.FLD with an extract function.</p>

		<field>VDATE.ADJUST</field>
		<desc>
			<p>All account interest capitalization accounting entries would have the booking date and value date different in T24.</p>
			<p>This is because even though the interest capitalization was booked on cob </p>
			<p>the value date has to be the next date since the value dated balances for accounts has to get reflected only on the next day.</p>
			<p>Hence this functionality would allow the user to specify that the interest needs to be updated to the previous day (value date – 1) in the tax database.</p>
