      <p>This table is used to define a discount factor applicable for the residual term. This factor is used while calculating amortization amounts using Rule of Anticipation method. The ID has 2 parts to it. The first part represents the insurance company ID as defined in USLREG.INSURANCE.COMPANY and the second part represents the term.</p>
      <p>The Rule of anticipation methods use this table to find the discount factor applicable for the loan term. If the residual term is 12M (or 1Y) and the insurance company is Metlife (defined in USLREG.INSURANCE.COMPANY with ID as 1)then it will look at the record 1-12 and get the discount factor. This will be used to find the monthly amortization amounts.</p>
