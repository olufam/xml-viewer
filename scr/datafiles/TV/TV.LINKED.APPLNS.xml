<field>BASE.APPLICATION</field>

<field>ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>ID must be given as SYSTEM. This template is used to define the application names that are linked to one another. Eg., Some of the linked applications are REPO with SECURITY.TRANSFER, FX.BULK.ORDER with FX.ORDER, SEC.OPEN.ORDER and SC.EXE.SEC.ORDERS with SEC.TRADE. Ie., when we authorise the SC.EXE.SEC.ORDERS then SEC.TRADE will be created, so this two applications are linked to one another. The main use of this template, is to obtain the same contracts in both capture and playback area, eventhough the transaction id varies. for eg., In captured area, when we auth FX.BULK.ORDER record , FX.ORDER is created as FX0033500012. But in the playback area, if we do the same FX.ORDER is created as FX0033500013 (due to change in locking record). Here FX0033500012 and FX0033500013 are same contracts, but the id's are different. With the help of linked applications, during FX0033500012 FX.ORDER playback, the contract id alone is changed from FX0033500012 to FX0033500013 in tSS request. We use a concate file called TV.LINKED.IDS to perform this.</p>
