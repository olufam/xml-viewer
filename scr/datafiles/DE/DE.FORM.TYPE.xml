            <p>The Form Type Table defines the width and depth of each printed form, and states which printer it is produced on. It is also used to specify output format for tabular FILE output from ENQUIRY.REPORT. </p>
            <p>A separate record on this table is required for each type of stationery on each printer. </p>
            <p>Whenever a new Form Type is used two new files will automatically be created for processing the Formatted Message Queue for that Form Type. </p>
            <p>Example: </p>
            <p>If a Form Type 'DRAFT' is created, then two new files will be created called DE.O.MSG.DRAFT and DE.O.PRI.DRAFT. </p>
            <p>Note : The files created when a new form type record is authorised or a        reversed record is restored will be created in the UFD named in the        first occurrence of MAIN.ACCOUNT on the SYSTEM record on the SPF        table.  For this reason, the first occurrence should contain the        name of the main data UFD for the bank. </p>
            <p>If a Form Type is reversed, the associated files described above must be empty and the outward formatting module (DE.O.SELECT.NEXT.MESSAG) must not be running. </p>
            <p>If these criteria are satisfied, the two files created when the record was input are deleted.  If the Form Type is later restored, the associated files will be created. </p>

<field>RPT.ATTRIBUTES</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the special print attributes to be used when the report/delivery output is printed. </p>
            <p>This field should contain the names of any special print attributes that are to be set up before the report/delivery output is printed e.g. LANDSCAPE, PORTRAIT mode etc. for laser printers. </p>
            <p>The attributes should relate to specific printers and must be defined on the PRINTER.ATTRIBUTES file.  The key to this field is a combination of the printer type and attribute name, e.g. QMS.LANDSCAPE.  The printer type should be defined in PRINTER.TYPE of the PRINTER.ID file. </p>

            <p>Specifies the ID of a printer that will print the Form Type defined by this record. Must be a valid entry on the PRINTER.ID file. </p>
            <p>For Delivery message output this should be a valid entry on the PRINTER.ID file, specifying the printer to which output should be directed. If this field is blank, T24 will refer to the USER record field </p>
            <p>PRINTER.FOR.RPTS</p>
            <p>For the REPORT.CONTROL system this field should be left blank unless you require all reports of this form to be sent to a single printer. This should only be used for special stationery requirements. The report control system will send the output to the printer defined on the PRINTER.ID file. </p>
