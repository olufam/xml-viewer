            <p>This file contains a single record that holds a number of parameters for the interface between T24 and the NOSTRO-PC program from STS (Swift Terminal Services), which is used to perform Nostro reconciliation between SWIFT messages and bank accounting. </p>
            <p>The SWIFT MT 950 messages are taken automatically by the NOSTRO-PC system, but T24 Nostro account statements have to be transmitted to the PC as pseudo-MT 950 messages. The T24 NOSTRO-PC interface does this automatically and transfers them to the PC either via diskettes or directly through the local network. </p>
            <p>In order for the SWIFT MT 950 messages to be processed they must have a message status of 'HOLD'. Once processed this status is then changed to '' (null). </p>
            <p>The T24 application used to initiate the process is a type 'W' routine called NOSTRO.INTERFACE. For more details refer to the relevant helptext. </p>

            <p>Defines the status of the T24 NOSTRO-PC interface. </p>
            <p>This field defines the state of the T24 NOSTRO-PC interface. </p>
            <p>When the status is OPEN then communication between T24 and NOSTRO-PC is active. </p>
            <p>When the status is CLOSED then communication between T24 and NOSTRO-PC is inactive. </p>

            <p>This fields specifies whether to print Nostro interface reports for audit trail purposes. </p>
            <p>If this field contains JOURNAL+STATUS then two reports will be printed. </p>
            <p>Report 1 is NOSTRO.INTERFACE.REPORT which is a report by currency broken down further by account number which shows the of the pseudo SWIFT MT 950 messages which have been extracted. </p>
            <p>Report 2 is NOSTRO.INTERFACE.STATUS which is a summary of the interface process. </p>

<field>DIVERT.ADDRESS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field specifies any addresses which are to be used to divert the SWIFT messages. </p>
            <p>One or more diversion addresses must be set up in order to utilise reconciliation with the NOSTRO-PC package. This means that for each company or customer, depending upon your requirements, a SWIFT.2 address should be set up on the DE.ADDRESS file where the delivery address should contain the contents of DIVERT.ADDRESS. Also the DE.PRODUCT file for 950 messages should include SWIFT.2 as one of the carrier address numbers. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>

<field>DOWNLOAD.CMD</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field defines the command to be used to physically copy the T24 data to the PC either via diskette or over a local network. </p>
            <p>Each multivalue is to be a separate command and subvalues are provided if the length of a command exceeds 35 characters. In this case spaces should not be unnecessarily put at the end or beginning of a line if the command is split since the subvalues will be concatenated together. </p>
            <p>For example if TERMITE is being used for the download to the PC then the download command would be : </p>
            <p>           6.1.1    PICK.DOS F.NOSTRO.PC.EXTRACT TEST T            6.1.2    O A:\NOS (HZ </p>
            <p>In the above example 'TEST' is the content of the file name specified in field 3 EXTRACT.FILE on NOSTRO.PARM, and the output is being written to drive A on the PC to a file called 'NOS'. The '(HZ' are two options which may be added if you do not wish see the display of the transfer and you do not want to any user acknowledgement. </p>
            <p>If REFLECTION 4 is being used for the download to the PC then the download command would be : </p>
            <p>           6.1.1    R4.SEND ../bnk.data/de/F.NOSTRO.006            6.1.2    /TEST A:\NOS[N] DELETE </p>
            <p>In the above example R4.SEND is the Reflection program used to transfer the data and the '../bnk.data/de/F.NOSTRO.006/TEST' is the full unix path name for a record called 'TEST' on the F.NOSTRO.PC.EXTRACT file. 'TEST' is the value held in field 3 EXTRACT.FILE on NOSTRO.PARM. The '../bnk.data/de/F.NOSTRO.006' is the second field on the VOC entry for the file F.NOSTRO.PC.EXTRACT. Since the value for this will vary from site to site it is important that the correct path is entered. </p>
            <p>The output is written to a file called 'NOS' on the A drive of the PC. The '[N]' specifies that extra characters may be entered by the user who will be prompted for these during the transfer process. Finally the 'DELETE' parameter means that any record with the same name already present on the diskette being written to will be deleted and overwritten. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>Up to 35 characters of type ANY - leading spaces allowed. Subvalued field. (Mandatory input).</p>

            <p>This field defines whether or not Nostro reconciliation is allowed for records prior to the last working day. </p>
            <p>If this field is set to 'YES' then the start and end dates defined on NOSTRO.INTERFACE may include dates prior to the last working day. </p>
            <p>Conversely if this field is set to 'NO' then the start and end dates defined on NOSTRO.INTERFACE must be greater than or equal to the last working day. </p>

<field>EXTRACT.FILE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field specifies the name of the file to be used to extract the statements fulfilling the requirements for the interface. </p>
            <p>This field specifies to which file the records for the NOSTRO-PC package will be written. </p>
            <p>This will be present on the file F.NOSTRO.PC.EXTRACT. Therefore if the entry made to this field is 'TEST' then it will be held as a record on the file F.NOSTRO.PC.EXTRACT. </p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
