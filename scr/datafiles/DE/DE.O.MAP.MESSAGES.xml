            <p>OVERVIEW OF THE MAPPING PROCESS =============================== </p>
            <p>The Mapping process extracts the fields required in the messages from the raw data that was passed to APPLICATION.HANDOFF by the banking applications and gives each message a header.  The messages are put onto the Unformatted Outward Queue. </p>
            <p>The key of an Unmapped message (i.e. raw data) is its date/time stamp. There are no priorities allocated at this stage, so the Mapping is done in date/time sequence.  When all messages have been Mapped there is a pause before the process starts again to see if any more Unmapped messages have been put on the queue.  This pause is controlled by the Wait Time specified in the System Status record. </p>
            <p>The raw data in an Unmapped message is a block of data dumped from a program in the layout defined in that program.  Different programs generating the same Message Type will produce different raw data, so each require a different record on the DE.MAPPING Table for converting the data into the same standard message and header. </p>
            <p>Fields in a message are put into positions that correspond to their definition in the DE.MESSAGE Table, so if we have: </p>
            <p>6.5 FIELD NAME  ORDERING CUSTOMER </p>
            <p>then the fifth field in the message record contains the ordering customer (This does not normally concern the user because the message contents cannot be looked at until they have been Formatted for output.) Fields on the header can be examined using DE.O.HEADER. </p>
