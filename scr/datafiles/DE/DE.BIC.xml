            <p>This application contains BIC data updated from SWIFT. BIC database is a SWIFT directory that lists institution identifiers recognised by the financial industry (for example, BICs, CHIPS UIDs, and national clearing codes).BIC Database Plus is expanded to include SEPA identifiers, such as national bank identifiers used in IBANs, IBAN formats, and BICs issued with IBANs. </p>
            <p />
            <p>The expanded database evolves into a new directory called BICPlusIBAN Directory.</p>
