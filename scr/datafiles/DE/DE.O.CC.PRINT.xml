            <p>OVERVIEW OF CARRIER CONTROL FOR PRINT ===================================== </p>
            <p>This process consists of moving Formatted messages onto the appropriate printer 'Spool Queues' controlled by the computer's operating system. </p>
            <p>A single Carrier Control module for all the different printed Form Types exists.  However, this does have the disadvantage that the terminal initiating it is not free until the task is completed.  If DE.O.CC.PRINT is entered directly as an application it is possible to print selectively for a particular Form Type, Priority and printer.  (Note : If printer is selected, all messages directed to that printer will be spooled.)  When print Carrier Control is run as a phantom it prints all Form Types, Priorities and printers. </p>
            <p>Messages are printed in Company, Customer and Account sequence. Therefore, it may be possible to put adjacent messages into the same envelope, but if both Formatting and Carrier Control run continuously the latter may run faster, so messages could print in the same sequence they are formatted in, which is usually date/time within Priority. </p>
