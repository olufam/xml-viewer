            <p>DE.SWIFT.BOOK File contains the names and addresses of all banks which use SWIFT.  The names and addresses are held by SWIFT address. </p>
            <p>The file is created initially from the SWIFT bank file tape issued by SWIFT.  A conversion program (DE.LOAD.SWIFT.BOOK) will load this tape and convert it to the DE.SWIFT.BOOK file format.  When a new tape is issued by SWIFT, the conversion program can be run to load up the new tape, cleaning the live, unauthorised and history SWIFT book files before loading up the new data.  In addition, the new records can be added and existing records can be amended or deleted. </p>
