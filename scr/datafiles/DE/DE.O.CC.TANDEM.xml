            <p>OVERVIEW OF OUTWARD TANDEM CARRIER CONTROL ========================================== </p>
            <p>This application controls the sending of messages to Tandem.  The mainframe the messages are sent to does not have to be Tandem, but must be connected via an asynchronous RS232 line and must be running a program compatible with Outward Tandem Carrier Control.  The messages sent to the mainframe are formatted according to the rules on DE.FORMAT.TELEXP, so that the contents of the messages are in a format acceptable to the mainframe. </p>
            <p>Formatted messages are passed one at a time, in printing order, to the mainframe running an equivalent of carrier control.  Integrity checking is performed by the mainframe and a response is sent back to indicate whether the message passed validation.  If it passed, the disposition of the message is updated to 'ACK' and the message is removed from the formatted file.  If the message failed validation, Outward Carrier Control will cancel, sending a message to the mainframe indicating that it has cancelled. </p>
