            <p>This application holds a cross reference between incoming delivery messages received from the Swiss clearing system, SIC, and the resulting Funds Transfer, generated by the FT.IN.SIC.PROCESSING routine. </p>
            <p>The file is used for enquiry purposes, and to ensure that the same message does not generate 2 or more Funds Transfers in a recovery situation. </p>
            <p>The record is created by the incoming SIC phantom when a message is received, and the Funds Transfer reference is added by the application FT.IN.SIC.PROCESSING. </p>
