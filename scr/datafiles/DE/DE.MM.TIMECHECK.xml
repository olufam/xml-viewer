            <p>OVERVIEW OF THE TIMECHECK PROCESS ================================= </p>
            <p>This module reads through the queue of messages on Hold.  Each message that has a Hold time earlier than the current time, and a hold date earlier than, or equal to the system date, has its Msg Status cleared.  If the message is suitable for batching (only certain telex messages) the message is moved to the batching file with the Msg Disposition set to 'BATCHING'.  If the message is not suitable for batching, the message is moved to the 'Ready' queue with the Msg Disposition set to 'FORMATTED'. </p>
            <p>After all messages on the Hold queue have been checked the Timecheck module waits until the Wait Time specified in the System Status record before checking the queue again. </p>
