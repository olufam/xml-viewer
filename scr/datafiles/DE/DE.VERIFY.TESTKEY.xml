            <p>The program allows the verification of testkeys on incoming messages.  On entering this application the messages currently awaiting verification are displayed.  The list may be refreshed by entering 'R'.  This will remove from the displayed list all messages which have been verified in the current session.  A message can be selected by entering the line number. The cursor may be moved up and down the list of messages in the normal way.  Entering 'I' for a message will enable the testkey to be verified and will display the message on the screen (which may also be paged through).  Note that testkeys may or may not be displayed in the message depending on the setting 'DISPLAY TEST KEY' in the parameter table (DE.PARM).  If the testkey entered does not match the testkey in the received message the message will be sent to the repair file after the maximum number of verification attempts allowed (set in DE.PARM).  A correctly verified testkey will pass the message through to inward routing.  After the input option is completed for a message the screen display will return to the list of messages awaiting verification. </p>
