<overview>
<ovdesc>

            <p>DE.ADDRESS File contains the names and address of a bank's customers and also of each company within the banking organisation.</p>
            <p>   The basic postal address of each Customer (Delivery Address ID = Company.C-Customer.PRINT.1) is automatically updated when the address is changed through Customer Maintenance.  This record on the Address file cannot be amended (except for the HOLD.OUPUT field), and its CURR.NO will always be 1.</p>
            <p>   DE.ADDRESS is used for inputting all addresses except 'PRINT.1', i.e. SWIFT addresses, Telex addresses and special postal addresses.</p>
            <p>   In a printed message all Customer names are from the PRINT.1 address except when the field specified is TO.ADDRESS from the Message Header. The Delivery Address record used for TO.ADDRESS is dependent upon the DE.PRODUCT file.</p>
            <p>   To input or update Customer addresses (other than PRINT.1) the user must sign on to the Company holding that Customer record.  For example, if Companies 'A' and 'B' share a Customer file located in Company 'A', then Customers Delivery Addresses can only be amended by signing on to Company 'A', even though Company 'B' uses the same Customer file.</p>
            <p>   In order to hold printed output for an account/customer the HOLD.OUTPUT field must be set.</p>

<field>ID</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the Company or Customer, carrier and address version number whose address is held in this record.</p>
            <p>   When the ID contains a Customer number the appropriate Customer company code is placed before it when building the key of this file.</p>
            <p>   Example:</p>
            <p>   If the input ID is C-405000.PRINT.3 (The 3rd delivery print address for Customer 405000.) and the Customer company is GB-003-2500, then it will go on file as GB0032500.C-405000.PRINT.3</p>
            <p>   If the INSTALL PARAMETER field on DE.PARM is 'R' (Resident) then:</p>
            <p>   a) Customer files will be checked to validate Customer numbers. b) Mnemonics can be entered in place of Customer numbers. c) The Company mnemonic can be used in place of the Company Code.</p>
            <p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
            </p>
            <p>   a)   Code or Mnemonic of the sign-on Company, which defaults for a      Customer address. b)   '.' c)   'C-' then a Customer number. (Required for a Customer address.) d)   '.' e)   The carrier, e.g. PRINT, SWIFT, TELEX (Mandatory input.) f)   '.' g)   2 numeric digits. (Mandatory input.)</p>
            <p>   The carrier must be an address carrier, i.e. the carrier must reference a carrier on the DE.CARRIER file in which the carrier address is the same as the id.  e.g. You may want to send two types of Telex messages, one using SWIFT format and one using free format messages.  However, you would not want to set up two sets of telex addresses.  Therefore, one type of Telex message would be defined on the carrier file as Telex, with a carrier address of Telex, formatting module of SWIFT and carrier module of Telex.  The free format messages would be defined on the carrier file as a carrier of Telexp, carrier address of Telex (so that they use Telex addresses on DE.ADDRESS), formatting module of Telexp and carrier module of Telex.</p>
