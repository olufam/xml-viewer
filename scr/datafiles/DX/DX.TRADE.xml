<ovdesc>

            <p>DX.TRADE is the main trade input routine for the Derivatives module.</p>
            <p>        All trades in the Derivatives module are double-sided, with one or more Primary counterparties (which may be customers, own-book dealers or brokers) versus a single Secondary counterparty.</p>
            <p>        The application provides powerful and intuitive features for the input of Derivatives trading data, allowing maturity dates, prices and commissions to be entered or automatically defaulted in the formats favoured by the Bank's back office.</p>

            <p>        Contains the account number of the secondary counterparty or nominated beneficiary (This is normally the broker) at their correspondent bank. </p>
            <p>        The field will be used to provide the correspondent with the necessary details to credit the counterparty's or beneficiary's account. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO No field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us ===================== We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas ====================================== To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally ===================================== Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty ==================================== The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank ================================ Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the Primary Counterparty (This would normally be a Customer.)or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. </p>
            <p>        Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field. </p>
            <p>        Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field. </p>
            <p>        It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Primary Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. </p>
            <p>        The primary counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>

            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>

            <p>        Identifies the bank to which the secondary counterparty (This is normally the broker) wishes the amount sold to be paid. This will either be the bank of the counterparty or the bank of their nominated beneficiary. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), the customer number of the bank will be entered in this field. If not, the details should be entered in the CPY.CORR.ADD field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank ABC in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        Identifies any intermediary bank involved in the transaction and will be specified by the primarycounterparty. </p>
            <p>        If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank will be entered in this field. If not, details should be entered in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        Contains the account number of the counterparty or nominated beneficiary at their correspondent bank. </p>
            <p>        The field will be used to provide the correspondent with the necessary details to credit the counterparty's or beneficiary's account. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO No field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us ===================== We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas ====================================== To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally ===================================== Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty ==================================== The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank ================================ Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        Identifies any intermediary bank involved in the transaction and will be specified by the primary counterparty (This would normally be the Customer.). </p>
            <p>        If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank should be entered in the INTERMED.BK.NO field. If not, details should be entered in this field. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the counterparty Corr No field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the CPARTY's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the CPARTY </p>
            <p>        The CPARTY may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the CPARTY may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the CPARTY or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in HK (the CPARTY correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the CPARTY or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        Identifies the bank to which the primary counterparty (This would normally be the bank) wishes the amount sold to be paid. This will either be the bank of the counterparty or the bank of their nominated beneficiary. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. </p>
            <p>        If the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the beneficiary details should be entered in the BENEFICIARY.NO field. If unknown to us, details should be entered in this multi-value field. Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. </p>
            <p>        It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the Intermed Add field. </p>

            <p>        If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank should be entered in the INTERMED.BK.NO field. If not, details should be entered in this field. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the counterparty Corr No field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the CPARTY's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the CPARTY </p>
            <p>        The CPARTY may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the CPARTY may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the CPARTY or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' in HK (the CPARTY correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the CPARTY or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p>        Identifies any intermediary bank involved in the transaction and will be specified by the counterparty. </p>
            <p>        If the intermediary is known to us (i.e. their is an associated customer record), the customer number of the intermediary bank will be entered in this field. If not, details should be entered in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several installments. </p>
            <p>        If the bank is known to us (i.e. a customer record exists), details should be entered in the CPARTY.CORR.NO field. If not, the should be entered in this multi-valued field. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us (i.e. there is no customer record), the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the Bank 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses Bank 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank 'XYZ' HK (the counterparty correspondent), account Bank 'ABC' (the counterparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

            <p />
            <p>        This field is used when the secondary counterparty (This is normally the broker.)of the deal instructs us to pay funds to another party who does not have an account with us. </p>
            <p>        When a contract matures, funds must be moved to actually settle the contract. This involves paying the counterparty or his nominated beneficiary for the currency sold and receiving funds for the currency purchased. The counterparty will advise us of where the money which we have sold is to be paid and we will advise them where we require the currency purchased to be remitted. The delivery of funds will normally be as one payment but may be in several instalments. </p>
            <p>        Entry in this field will be accepted where the beneficiary is known to the bank (i.e. there is a customer record for the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is not known to us, the beneficiary details may be entered in the Beneficiary address field. </p>
            <p>        Note that, where the beneficiary requests the funds into an account he has with us, this should be specified in the Our Account Pay field. </p>
            <p>        It is important to note that when the Beneficiary is specified, the Counterparty Correspondent field will be used to indicate the bank of the beneficiary. </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may ask us to pay the amount sold in a number of ways: </p>
            <p>        To an account with us </p>
            <p>        We may pay the funds directly into an account provided it is in the same currency as that being sold. To make payment directly to a counterparty's internal account the relevant account number should be entered in the Our Account Pay field and no other input will be necessary in this field. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank overseas </p>
            <p>        To pay money to another bank overseas we would have to advise our agent, in the country concerned, to pay to the counterparty's bank. In this case, the Nostro account number of our agent should be entered in the Our Account Pay field. If the counterparty's bank is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), then the bank's number should be entered in CPARTY.CORR.NO if these details have not yet been defined on the Agency file. If the bank is not known to us, (i.e. there is no customer record) the bank's name and address should be entered in the multi-valued field CPARTY.CORR.ADD. When known, the counterparty's account number at his bank should be entered in the field CPARTY.BANK.ACC. </p>
            <p>        To an account at another bank locally </p>
            <p>        Where payment is to be effected locally, settlement can be through a number of different methods. The most common are Banker's Payments, CHIPS, or CHAPS. In all cases, the number of our internal clearing account, or our clearing agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. Details of the counterparty's bank account should be completed as detailed above. </p>
            <p>        To a beneficiary of the counterparty </p>
            <p>        The counterparty may nominate a third party beneficiary of the funds. If the beneficiary is to be paid by crediting an account with us, the account number should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. If the beneficiary does not have an account with us, the internal clearing number or Nostro account of our agent should be entered in OUR.ACCOUNT.PAY. </p>
            <p>        Where we are paying to another bank but the beneficiary is known to us (i.e. there is a customer record), the customer number of the beneficiary will be entered in the field BENEFICIARY.NO. Where no relationship exists, the payment details will be entered in the multi-valued field BENFCY.ADD. </p>
            <p>        Payment via an intermediary bank </p>
            <p>        Occasionally the counterparty may ask for payment to be made through an intermediary bank. This occurs where the counterparty or beneficiary's correspondent is not in the country of the currency involved. As an example, let us say that the BANK 'ABC' in Hong Kong uses BANK 'XYZ' in Hong Kong as their dollar agent. When a dollar payment is to be made we would pay American Bank in New York (the Intermediary) for Bank XYZ in HK (the Cparty correspondent), account Bank ABC (the Cparty or Beneficiary). The Intermediary can be entered as a number in the INTERMED.BK.NO field if a customer relationship exists (i.e. there is a customer number) or as narrative in the INTERMED.ADD field. </p>

 <p>Part of Regulatory Reporting information to a Trade Repository</p>     
 <p>All Trades should have a Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) which is generated, communicated and matched.</p>
 <p>Determination of who generates the UTI should follow the existing industry best practices for that Asset class.</p>
 <p>The UTI.USI.API attached in OC.PARAMETER and invoked during DX.TRADE input determines who is the party responsible for UTI generation and does the following.</p>
<p>•	If a value is present during deal capture the API is not invoked, on the assumption that the UTI is generated and supplied by the other Counterparty.</p>
<p>•	If no value is present during the deal capture, the API is invoked to determine the party responsible for generating the UTI. If the Other counterparty is responsible, still an UTI is generated with a suffix as TEMP to show that the UTI from the other counterparty is awaited and in the meantime, the reporting is done with a Temporary ID. If T24 Bank is responsible for UTI generation, then the same is generated without TEMP.</p> 
<p>•	Where a reporting has been made with UTI having TEMP as suffix and subsequently the Counterparty supplies the UTI, the following procedure has to be followed to ensure reporting with actual UTI.</p>
<p>•	The field Action Type needs to be changed to ‘E’ and record to be authorized. Later, the UTI field should be modified with the actual UTI received. Set the Action Type field to ‘N’ and authorize the record. In this way, the previous reporting gets cancelled and the new reporting goes with correct UTI. </p>
<p>•    For FX OTC trades, the UTI will be defaulted by considering Customer and Bank as the DEALCPARTY and BANKCPARTY.</p>
<p>•    For ETD trades between customer and broker where bank act as Implied Principal,the UTI would be supplied by broker.</p>
