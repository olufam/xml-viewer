            <p>The main file within this module, FRA.DEAL, is split into 3 distinct parts. </p>
            <p>Part one stores the basic elements, either input or table generated defaults, essential to the FRA processing.  Such details are; Counterparty ID, rates, type of FRA (Hedge or Trade), dates (Start, maturity and trade), and additionally, where appropriate, Broker ID's, commissions and charges and calculation parameters. </p>
            <p>The second part of the record facilitates the settlement of the FRA deal, when, on rate fixing day, the prevailing settlement rate is input and actioned accordingly.  Settlement accounts, addresses and relevant narratives for the delivery/receipt of advices and payments are picked up from here. </p>
            <p>The third part stores the internally generated fields, providing accrual information, LCY equivalents of amount fields, status on advices and payments sent, and references to consolidation of generated transactions. </p>

            <p>Contains the Counterparty reference for the second Beneficiary Bank for the Settlement Amount. Used where contracts involve four party transfers of funds. </p>
            <p>If for example, at the start date of a FRA, the customer requests the delivery of the settlement amount to his  account that he maintains with American Bank A, Detroit which has an account with American Bank B, New York, the User will then make the following input: </p>
            <p>        (i) Default (or Enter) the standard Nostro account number in the             SETTLEMENT.ACCT. This field is always used to indicate the             account where the book-keeping entries must be recorded by the             system. </p>
            <p>       (ii) Enter the Agent code (Customer number) of the American Bank B,             New York, in BEN.BANK.1. In case this Bank does not exist on             the Database, the User can then enter the name and address of             this Bank in BANK.ADDR. </p>

            <p>This field is used when the counterparty does not require the funds to be credited to his current account but instead requests an external delivery of the funds to a Bank different to the one where you maintain your Nostro account. </p>
            <p>If this Bank does not yet exist on the Database, the user may: </p>
            <p>      a) Create a new record in the CUSTOMER and AGENCY file which will          contain the information necessary to generate automatically          advices, confirmations etc. for this bank or, </p>
            <p>      b) Use the Bank ADDRESS to directly input the name and address of          the Counterparty Bank without having to create a Customer and/or          an Agent record.  This option is very useful if the settlement          amount has to be paid to a bank which is rarely dealt with. </p>

<field>SETTLEMENT.AMT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the value of the amount to be settled. </p>
            <p>On the RATE.FIX.DATE of the FRA agreement, the fixed rate of the contract is compared with the  settlement rate and counterparties settle between them the value of the interest rate differential on the agreed principal over the agreed period. Since the interest rate differencial is paid in advance at the START.DATE of the fixed rate period, the settlement amount is DISCOUNTED as per formula indicated in addendum. Thus, the settlement amount of a FRA is the profit or loss that is realised upon the settlement (START) date, and whose value is discounted back from the date of maturity. </p>
            <p>       1. When the SETTLEMENT.RATE is greater than the INTEREST.RATE of           the FRA contract then: </p>
            <p>          -     If the FRA contract is an Asset (SALE), then the                 settlement amount is a LOSS and the settlement amount will                 be displayed with a "-" (minus) sign. </p>
            <p>          -     If the FRA contract is a Liability (PURCHASE), then the                 settlement amount is a PROFIT and the settlement amount                 will be displayed with a "+" (positive) sign. </p>
            <p>       2. When the SETTLEMENT.RATE is smaller than the INTEREST.RATE of           the FRA contract then: </p>
            <p>          -     If the FRA contract is an Asset (SALE), then the                 settlement amount is a PROFIT and the settlement amount                 will be displayed with a "+" (positive) sign. </p>

<field>STMT.NO</field>
<desc>
            <p>A sub-value number generated automatically by the system which identifies either a statement entry or a category entry in respect of a contract. </p>
            <p>The system will automatically insert a number into this field and this number may refer to a statement entry or a category entry depending on the value contained in the corresponding multivalue fields. The following examples will illustrate the use of this field. </p>
            <p>          Example 1:           On the start date of a FRA contract there will be an entry on           the Settlement Account and the following type of number will be           generated at this field: </p>
            <p>          SV1 STMT.NO ........... 673732684.48           SV2 STMT.NO ........... 1 </p>
            <p>          The number automatically generated in S.V.1 is unique to the           contract in question and is built in the following way: </p>
            <p>          1. The first four digits '6737' indicate the number of days              since the 1st of January 1968. In our example, it corresponds              to the 11th of June 1986. </p>
            <p>          2. The next five digits '32684' indicate the number of seconds              since midnight. In our example, it corresponds to an entry              generated on line at 09:04:44 AM. </p>
            <p>          3. The last two digits '48' indicate the number of hundreds of              seconds. </p>
            <p>             The value assigned (again automatically) to S.V.2 identifies              the number in S.V.1 as a statement entry number. If the user              wishes to call this statement entry record on to the screen              the user will invoke the STMT.ENTRY Application and then type              the following at 'AWAITING ID': </p>
            <p>             67372684.480001 </p>
            <p>             where the suffix '0001' identifies it as the first              statement entry (there may be more than one as the next              example will illustrate). </p>
            <p />
            <p>          Example 2:           A second example outlined here is similar to example 1 in that           there is a statement entry on start date for both the           Settlement Account and the CHG/COM Acct. The system handles this           case as follows: </p>
            <p>          SV.1   STMT.NO ........... 673732684.48           SV.2   STMT.NO ........... 1-2 </p>
            <p>          Once again S.V.1 contains the identification number           automatically generated by the system while S.V.2 now contains           two separate numbers signifying that there are in fact two           separate statement entries, one in respect of the Settlement           Account and one in respect of the CHG/COM Acct. If the user           wishes to see either of these he must first of all invoke           STMT.ENTRY followed by the desired function and then at           'AWAITING ID' type either: </p>
            <p>                673732684.480001 </p>
            <p>          where the addition of the suffix '0001' identifies the           statement entry in respect of the settlement account or, </p>
            <p>                673732684.480002 </p>
            <p>          where the addition of the suffix '0002' identifies the           statement entry in respect of the CHG/COM ACCT. </p>
            <p />
            <p>          Example 3:           A third example might be that of a category entry generated at           initiation of a contract where commission or charges have been           debited to the customer and credited to a profit and loss           category code. In this case the following entries are generated           on the contract: </p>
            <p>          SV1 STMT.NO ............... 673732684.48           SV3 STMT.NO ............... 1 </p>
            <p>          Once again the standard type number is generated and inserted at           S.V.1. </p>
            <p>          Now, however, S.V.2 is replaced by S.V.3 which now identifies           the number in S.V.1 as a category entry and not a statement           entry. </p>
            <p>          To call this category entry record onto the screen the user must           now type: </p>
            <p>          CATEG.ENTRY at 'AWAITING APPLICATION' </p>
            <p>          followed by: </p>
            <p>          673732684.480001 at 'AWAITING ID' </p>

            <p>In the event that the user confirms the Override, the full text of the actual Override Message will be stored, for reference purposes on in this multivalue field. </p>
            <p>For example, if the user inserts an 'abnormal' interest rate in the field corresponding to the interest rate then when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads: </p>
            <p>'VARIANCE OF RATE EXCEEDS PERMITTED TOLERANCE' </p>
            <p>This will draw the user's attention to the rate entered, which may be a mistake and can then be corrected, or, on the other hand, it may be correct input and so the user confirms that this rate is really intended. </p>
            <p>A second example might be in respect of a contract done with a client who has a credit line established with the bank but where the start date of the intended FRA contract goes beyond the credit line expiry date. In this case when the deal is validated a warning bell will sound and a message will appear, at the foot of the screen, which reads: </p>
            <p>'LINE EXPIRES BEFORE TXN START DATE' </p>
            <p>Once again the user's attention is drawn to the situation and either corrected or conrimed via a positive response to the Override Message. </p>

            <p />
            <p>HEDGE Transactions </p>
            <p>Because the maturity dates of deposits and other sources of funds available in the market do not always sufficiently match the maturity of banks' assets, bankers make use of interest rate hedging instruments to reduce their interest gap exposure to acceptable limits.  The FRAs have become today a popular alternative to Financial Futures as a means of hedging interest rate exposure. In order for a bank to enter into a FRA for hedging purposes, the following conditions will apply: </p>
            <p>      1. The bank must have net assets or liabilities which are subject to          interest rate risk. This condition must exist after commitments          and anticipated transactions reducing the risk have been taken          into account. </p>
            <p>      2. The FRA transaction must be designated as a hedge and must reduce          the interest rate risk on exposed assets and liabilities. </p>
            <p>As it can be seen, a conscious decision is done at deal level and since FRAs may be tailored into individual requirements, it is easier for such a trade to qualify as a hedge than for normal exchange governed Financial Futures. </p>
            <p />
            <p>TRADING Transactions </p>
            <p>Apart from Hedging facilities, bankers will operate for other purposes such as general trading and arbitrage. Since such activities may be deemed to be of a more speculative nature, the concept of revaluing such positions is of importance. </p>
            <p>In order to allow the segregation of the above trade concepts, the input of trades requires the inclusion of the type of trade. This will allow the system to distinguish trades into their relevant categories both for accounting purposes and for revaluing. </p>

If this account exists on the Nostro table,           it will then be used to record the credit accounting entry. If           at the Nostro table more than one nostro exists per currency,           the system will default to the first account listed. However,           the user has the ability to select which Nostro account by           entering 'A' to give the first, 'B' to give the second and so           forth. If no account is defined on the Nostro table, </p>
            <p>       d) The user will then need to enter an account number which can be           a customer account, a nostro account or an internal account. The           internal account details must be present on the FX.TEXT table.           Input to this field for internal accounts must be entered in the           format 1 to give the first account: 2 to give the second and so           forth as detailed on the FX.TEXT table. </p>

 <p>Part of Regulatory Reporting information to a Trade Repository</p>     
 <p>All Trades should have a Unique Transaction Identifier (UTI) which is generated, communicated and matched</p>
 <p>Determination of who generates the UTI should follow the existing industry best practices for that Asset class</p>
 <p>The UTI.USI.API attached in OC.PARAMETER and invoked during FRA deal capture determines who is the party responsible for UTI generation and does the following.
•	If a value is present during deal capture the API is not invoked, on the assumption that the UTI is generated and supplied by the other Counterparty.
•	If no value is present during the deal capture, the API is invoked to determine the party responsible for generating the UTI. If the Other counterparty is responsible, still an UTI is generated with a suffix as TEMP to show that the UTI from the other counterparty is awaited and in the meantime, the reporting is done with a Temporary ID. If T24 Bank is responsible for UTI generation, then the same is generated without TEMP. 
•	Where a reporting has been made with UTI having TEMP as suffix and subsequently the Counterparty supplies the UTI, the following procedure has to be followed to ensure reporting with actual UTI.
•	The field Action Type needs to be changed to ‘E’ and record to be authorized. Later, the UTI field should be modified with the actual UTI received. Set the Action Type field to ‘N’ and authorize the record. In this way, the previous reporting gets cancelled and the new reporting goes with correct UTI. </p>

	 <p> N denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is NEW. Value of 'N' is defaulted for a new contract. User is also allowed to change the status to N if the previous status is E. </p>
	 <p> E denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is REVERSE or Correction. In case of wrongly entered UTI values or a Temporary UTI was used previously, the old UTI should be reported with ACTION.TYPE as 'E' for error reporting first and then change the Action Type to NEW after keying in the actual UTI. This way the previous reporting with temporary UTI is replaced by the one with final UTI. Action Type ‘E’ is also used to undo the reporting of a particular transaction done which should not have been done reported at all in the first instance.</p>
	<p> M denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is MODIFIED. In case of change in the RATE.FIXING.DATE the ACTION.TYPE is set to 'M'</p>
<p> C denotes that the ACTION.TYPE is CANCELLED. In case of any change in maturity/value date i.e. early termination of the contract should be reported with C. In FRA this MATURITY.DATE field is No change field. So ACTION.TYPE never gets populated automatically with type as C but It can be manually updated as ‘c’ and the contract can be cancelled. </p> 
<p> Z denotes Compression update. This means the trade being reported is generated out of a compression activity. </p>
