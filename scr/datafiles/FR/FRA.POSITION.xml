            <p>INTRODUCTION </p>
            <p>A specific Position file will be maintained by POSITION.TYPE for the FRA transactions. It must be mentioned again that ONLY "TRADE" contracts will update the FRA position file. All Hedge contracts, by definition, do not create a position or a risk for the bank and consequently are totally excluded from the FRA position. </p>
            <p>For FRA "TRADE" deals, the profit/loss for a closure is maintained on the position file. The day's profit/loss is maintained online, but posted as part of the end of day run. The day's opening position is held as well as the current position. </p>
            <p>All updating of the positions will take place at Input time immediately after successful validation. </p>
            <p>The order the deals are input will be maintained for recalculation purposes. When a deal is loaded for a previous trade date then the days opening position will be recalculated. </p>
