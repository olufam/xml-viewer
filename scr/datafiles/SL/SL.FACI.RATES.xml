            <p>Table used to define the interest rates applicable to different facilities. </p>
            <p>Interest rates applicable for drawings under facility may be defined in this table so as to get defaulted to SL.LOANS. In order to provide ability to define default interest rates for each of the 'ALLOWED.CURRENCY'  under the facility, the ID of this file is the ID of the facility concatenated with the desired currency.</p>
            <p>The rates defined in this table is used as a mere default and is modifiable at the deal level.</p>

            <p>The value of spread that is to be defaulted to SL.LOANS for drawings in this currency.</p>

            <p>ID of this file is the ID of the FACILITY record, concatenated with a three alpha currency mnemonic. Example - SL0025000012USD where SL0025000012 is the ID of the facility and USD the currency code.</p>

            <p />
            <p>The SL reference for which default rates are provided must be an       authorised record on the FACILITY file.</p>
            <p>Currency mnemonic should be a valid record on the CURRENCY table</p>
            <p>Since this table is used only to define default rates, there would no       validation that the currency named, is an ALLOWED.CURRENCY in the       FACILITY. </p>
