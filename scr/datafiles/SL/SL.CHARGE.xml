            <p>This application enables the user to take charges for a FACILITY or a LOAN.</p>
            <p />
            <p>On input of a CHG.ACTIVITY in this application, the pre-defined charges for the activity are defaulted by the system in to this table, with the possibility of user intervention for addition or deletion.</p>
            <p />On committing the record, calculations are done and the charge amounts are populated.<p />Apart from the charge amounts, the amounts that are due to each participant is arrived at and written into the appropriate fields, depending on the value in the field APPLY.TO.ALL being YES. <p /><p>Charges due to the T24 Bank could be amortised or recognised immediately in P&amp;L. </p><p /></ovdesc>

<field>CHG.CALC.BASIS</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field is meant for the user to define the basis of calculation of the charge. Depending on the value in this field, the system will derive the CHG.BASE.AMT. In other words, the value in this field will determine the base amount on which the charge is to be calculated.  </p>
            <p>Accepted values are FACILITY.ORIG/FACILITY.OS/LOAN.ORIG/LOAN.OS/PART.SHARE /ADHOC. </p>
            <p>FACILITY.ORIG would mean that charges would be calculated on the original facility amount.</p>
            <p>FACILITY.OS would mean that charges would be calculated on the outstanding facility amount or in other words the undrawn portion of the facility. </p>
            <p>LOAN.ORIG would mean that charges would be calculated on the original loan amount.</p>
            <p>LOAN.OS would mean that charges would be calculated on the outstanding loan amount.</p>
            <p>PART.SHARE would mean that charges would be calculated participant wise taking the paticipant's share as the base amount.</p>
            <p>ADHOC would mean that the charges would be calculated based on the amount input by the user. The system would not derive any amount for calculation when this option is chosen and the user input of  a CHG.BASE.AMT is mandatory.</p>
