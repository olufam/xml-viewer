            <p />
            <p>The table SL.RATE.FIX would be used to record the rates quoted by several banks on a given day. In a syndicate, there could be a stipulation that the average rate quoted by N number named banks would be the applicable interest rate for any drawings under the facility. In such scenario, the Agent needs to record the rates quoted by the named banks and update this rate onto T24. </p>
            <p />
            <p>The manner in which the average (applicable) rate would be drawn from the rates quoted may differ and hence it would be also be possible to attach a routine to perform such calculation. System would support three types of decisions to take the </p>
            <p>Highest Rate, Lowest Rate and  the Mean Rate.</p>

            <p>System supports three types of calculations </p>
            <p>HIGH - Highest rate quoted (amongst the recorded figures) would be reckoned as the effective rate</p>
            <p>LOW - Lowest rate quoted would be construed as the effective rate</p>
            <p>MEAN - Simple average of the rates quoted will be the effective rate</p>
            <p>The bank could attach a its own local routine to calculate the effective rate in this field, if the calculation is to be handled differently. In this case the input in this field would be @ followed by the routine name (with no space in between) Ex @CALC if CALC is the name of the routine</p>
