            <p />
            <p>Charges are collected for various events. For example when a facility is granted, Front-end fee may be collected along with documentation charges etc. It is possible to group the charges defined in FT.COMMISSION.TYPE or FT.CHARGE.TYPE and collect them for a particular event. The bank must first define all the charges and commissions applicable to such facilities in FT.COMMISSION.TYPE or FT.CHARGE.TYPE table. These charges can be grouped in SL.CHARGE.ACTIVITY for defaulting, when the charges are taken through SL.CHARGES table.</p>
            <p />
            <p>While taking charges through SL.CHARGE, the ID of SL.CHARGE.ACTIVITY only needs to be input and the system would default all the applicable charges.</p>

<field>AMORT.FREQ</field>
<desc>
            <p>Field to accept the frequency at which the charge taken is to be amortized. This is a standard frequency field. Input accepted only if amortization is set to YES. Input is to be in the form of M0131 where M denotes Monthly,  01 denotes  every month,  and  31 denotes the date of amortization.</p>

<field>AMORT.PERIOD</field>
<desc>
            <p>Field to accept the period up to which the charge is to be amortized. This field can be input only if amortization is set to YES.</p>
            <p>For eg.</p>
            <p> if the charge is to be amortized over a period of 6 months, a value 6M is to be input in this field ; if the charge is to be amortized over a period of 2 years, a value 2Y is to be input in this field  and in case the user desires to amortize the charge over the life of the contract a value "C" is to be input in this field.</p>

            <p>Accepted values are  1M,2M....11M,  1Y, 2Y.... and        "C" in case the amortization is to be done for the entire life       of the contract.</p>

<t>
<field>APPLY.TO.ALL</field>
<desc>
            <p>Field to say whether the charges taken are to be split among the participants in the ratio of FACILITY/LOAN as the case may be.  An input of YES means that the charges are to be split among the participants.  An input of NO would mean that the charge in full is for the agent.</p>
