            <p>This application is used to record interest and commitment fee rates for different participants in the facility. The various situations and its impact is discussed below;</p>
            <p> Same     interest rate is applicable for the borrower and all participants</p>
            <p>  SL.RATES.PART is not defined at all.</p>
            <p>  Interest rate (or spread) in the Facility is defaulted at the SLL. The user would be allowed to change this rate with an override. The user can also blank out this field and provide a holding rate alone. Both holding rate and interest rate (or spread if floating) may not be defined in SLL at the same time.</p>
            <p> If holding rate is provided initially and then an actual rate is given, holding rate will be blanked off and record committed. Accounting entries for accrual-adjust will be raised online for the difference between holding and actual interest rates. The rate so given should be equal to the interest rate (or spread) in FACILITY or else override will be produced. Once a holding rate is given it cannot be modified.</p>
            <p />
            <p> Interest     rate applicable is different among participants and the borrower pays the     weighted average rate</p>
            <p> In this case SL.PART.RATES is defined with appropriate rates for each participant. The weighted average rate is manually calculated and provided in FACILITY, which will be defaulted to SL.LOAN record.</p>
            <p> Interest     rate applicable is different among the participants and the borrower. The     Agent skims the difference</p>
            <p> In this scenario, the difference between the borrower interest and participants interest is accounted in the internal account category provided in SL.PARAMETER. For example if the total interest charged to the borrower is 100 and the share of other participants is 60 and Agents share is 30. Accounting is as follows if liquidation mode is AUTOMATIC </p>
            <p>  Dr </p>
            <p> Nostro/customer a/c 100</p>
            <p> Amount paid by borrower </p>
            <p> Cr</p>
            <p> Accrual Asset Type</p>
            <p> 30</p>
            <p> Agents share</p>
            <p> Cr</p>
            <p> Nostro </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> 60</p>
            <p> Other participants share (as many entries) Cr</p>
            <p> Internal Account</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> If liquidation mode is Internal, only T24 banks portion is accounted and SL.OD.DUES files are built. The skim profit or loss is accounted only when SL.ROUND.ADJ is used.</p>
            <p> New     rates defined and  Apply Curr Loans</p>
            <p> In SL.RATES.PART it would be possible to define the new interest rate / spread applicable for any/all participants with an effective date. Such effective date may be GE process date and not backdated. On the effective date, the new interest is applied on the respective participants share in the loan (for SLL) or commitment available amount (for Commitment fee) and balance files are to be updated with revised amount. If change is made to ALL or for OWN.CUST.REF, accruals will be performed for the new rates from the given effective date. At any point in time only one forward interest rate change can be recorded. </p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p> Ability to apply the new interest rate for all existing drawings under the facility is available by flagging APPLY.CURR.LOANS field.</p>

            <p> In order to facilitate easy definition, value ALL may be substituted in place of the participant ID. In the event that the new rate is effective for all participants under the facility the value ALL may be used instead of defining SL.RATES.PART for each participant.</p>
