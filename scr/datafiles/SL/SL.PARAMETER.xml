<field>SL.MSG.CLASS</field>

            <p>SL.MSG.CLASS and EB.MSG.CLASS are used to formulate the class mapping between SL internal class and EB.MESSAGE.CLASS. The main driving concept of ACTIVITY and CLASS has lend itself to facilitate the user by automatically trigger only the message related to the operation, which user  currently do. In a sense, the system will try to default a sensible CLASS tiding to corresponding activity, and populate the information on the SL transaction. Consequently, the user can take control of the class to choose whether he/she wants to produce as per suggestion by the system.</p>
