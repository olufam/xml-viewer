            <p />
            <p>  If during the life of the Syndicate, one of the Participants sells either a portion or the entire un-availed amount to another Bank, the share of participation needs to be redefined. The details of such transaction are recorded in this template.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  Sale of participation may happen either during the drawdown period or during the repayment period. Any premium paid/received on such sale or purchase may also be recorded and either taken to P&amp;L immediately or amortised over the life of the syndicate.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  Apart from catering to buying and selling of un-availed amount and loan, any principal movement in the facility may also be recorded. The system would rebuild the participants share in the facility and tranche and raise appropriate accounting entries for GLOBUS Bank.</p>

            <p>  This field represents the tranche code under the facility in which the principal movement is to be effected.</p>
            <p>   For example a facility has two tranches with tranche codes 001 and 002. The amount of facility is increased by 100,000 of which tranche 001 is increased by 60,000 and tranche 002 by 40,000. This information may be input as follows:</p>

            <p>  Each of the 4 digits are arrived at as below :</p>
            <p>  The first digit indicates the application for which the activity has been generated. Presently it has three values  viz. 1 -  PRE    2 - FACILITY and  3 - SL.LOAN</p>
            <p>  The second digit indicates the operation done under each application.  Presently it has six values viz.       0 - OTHERS     1 - INPUT     2 - AMENDMENT     3 - NOTICE      4 - CONFIRMATION           5 - REVERSAL</p>
            <p>  The third digit indicates the component for which the message is being generated viz. Principal or Interest or commitment fee etc.  Presently it has five values viz.   0 - OTHERS   1 - PRINCIPAL                         2 - COMMITMENT FEE     3 - INTEREST     4 - CHARGES</p>
            <p>  The fourth digit indicates to whom the message is being generated, whether to the participant or to the borrower  or  to both.  Presently it has three values viz.  1 -  PARTICIPANT ONLY                             2 - PARTICIPANT AND BORROWER    3 - BORROWER ONLY</p>
            <p>  For example when a new loan is drawn down and message to be sent to borrower,  the activity generated would be SL-3103 meaning 3-LOAN, 1-INPUT, 0-OTHERS(since it involves all components) and 3-BORROWER.</p>

<field>TRANCHE.CODE</field>

            <p>When a facility is defined with tranches the available amount under each tranche is held separately for drawdown management. Further individual participants' share is held at tranche level also. For a Contingent buy/sell transaction (buy/sell of available amount) , the tranche under which trading is done needs to be captured to update the revised share of participation at the tranche level. The tranche under a facility is uniquely identified by a code and the same may be input here.</p>

<field>TOT.CONSIDERATION</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the amount of consideration for a contingent buy/sell transaction. </p>
            <p>  It is possible to record a transaction involving bulk sale of loans (NC type) denominated the same currency. This is done by multivaluing SL.Ref.No field which is associated with fields SL.Amount, Consideration and Cons.Perc. The sum of values in Consideration field in the multivale sets is populated in this field. </p>
            <p>  Example : GLOBUS Bank has participation in two drawings to the extent of USD 10,000 and USD 20,000. These two drawings are sold for a consideration of USD 11,000 and USD 19,500 respectively, which may be input in the field Consideration or Cons.Perc in each multivalue set. The total consideration for the transaction is USD 30,500. This value is calculated by the system and populated in Tot.Consideration field.  </p>
            <p>  For a Non Contingent buy/sell transaction fund flow would happen for the value in this field, if GLOBUS Bank is involved in the transaction. </p>

<field>CONSIDERATION</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the amount of consideration for buy/sell of the loan. A loan may be traded at  premium or discount. The consideration amount includes the premium or discount. For a Non-Contingent  buy/sell involving GLOBUS Bank, fund flow would take place for the value in this field. For a Contingent buy/sell involving GLOBUS Bank, fund flow would take place for the discount or premium amount only. The consideration may be expressed either as an absolute amount or as a percentage to the value under consideration. If expressed in absolute amount, the same may be input in this field. </p>
            <p>  Example</p>
            <p>  1) GLOBUS Bank sells its share of USD 100,000 in a loan to Participant A. The loan is sold for a consideration of USD 110,000 (at a premium). In such case either the consideration amount of USD 110,000 may be entered in this field or the consideration percentage of 110% may be entered in Cons.Perc field. In this case GLOBUS Bank would receive USD 110,000 from Participant A of which USD 10,000 would be accounted as profit on sale of loan.</p>
