            <p />
            <p>The template caters to rollover, merger (consolidation) or splitting of existing draw down/s under the same facility and with same maturity dates. The resultant loans can be in different currency, for a different tenor and with different interest rate/spread.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Rollover</p>
            <p />
            <p>Rollover option may be chosen if one existing drawing is to be rolled over for a further period in the same or different currency. That is there would be one underlying drawing and the resultant drawing would also be one, though the currency may be different.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Merger</p>
            <p />
            <p>Merger option may be chosen if more than one existing drawing are to be merged into one or more drawing. The resultant drawing/s could be in any allowed currency. The maturity date of all the existing drawing to be merged must be the same.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Split</p>
            <p />
            <p>Split option may be chosen of one existing drawing is to be split into many drawings. The resultant drawings could be in any allowed currency.</p>
            <p />
            <p>For each of the above options further flexibility is available to cater to the following</p>
            <p />

<field>IDNAME</field>
<desc>
            <p>The @ID of the record is Pre-Syndication ID-TR-Tranche code-4 digit sequence number.</p>
            <p>It is sufficient if the user input the Pre-Syndication ID and the tranche code. The system would generate the ID as explained below:</p>
            <p>Example - </p>
            <p>Pre-Syndication ID        -    SL/01088/00001</p>
            <p>Facility ID                     - SL/01088/00001/01  </p>
            <p>Tranche Code                - 001</p>
            <p>If the user inputs SL0108800001001, the system would generate the ID SL/01088/00001-TR-001-0001</p>

            <p>Defines the kind of activity to be performed on the drawings under a facility on the maturity date. The allowed options are ROLLOVER or MERGER or SPLIT. The drawings under a facility may be done in any of the allowed currencies. On the maturity date a drawing could be rolled over for a further period in any of the allowed currencies. Few drawings could be merged into one or more drawings in any of the allowed currencies. Similarly a drawing could be split into more than one drawing in any of the allowed currencies.</p>

            <p>Applicable when an existing drawing denominated in one of the optional currency (any allowed currency other than the base currency) is rolled over into the same optional currency. If the RMS amount (new deal amount) exceeds the original drawing amount by a percentage greater than the value mentioned in this field, then RMS amount is retained as the new drawing amount. If the variance is less than the value in this field the old drawing amount is retained as the RMS amount. During Rollover if any Increase or Decrease of Principal if effected, then this variance will not be checked and the Transactions will occur at current rate only.</p>

            <p>Each of the 4 digits are arrived at as below :</p>
            <p>The first digit indicates the application for which the activity has been generated. Presently it has three values  viz. 1 -  PRE    2 - FACILITY and  3 - SL.LOAN</p>
            <p>The second digit indicates the operation done under each application.  Presently it has six values viz.       0 - OTHERS     1 - INPUT     2 - AMENDMENT     3 - NOTICE      4 - CONFIRMATION           5 - REVERSAL</p>
            <p>The third digit indicates the component for which the message is being generated viz. Principal or Interest or commitment fee etc.  Presently it has five values viz.   0 - OTHERS   1 - PRINCIPAL                         2 - COMMITMENT FEE     3 - INTEREST     4 - CHARGES</p>
            <p>The fourth digit indicates to whom the message is being generated, whether to the participant or to the borrower  or  to both.  Presently it has three values viz.  1 -  PARTICIPANT ONLY                             2 - PARTICIPANT AND BORROWER    3 - BORROWER ONLY</p>
            <p>For example when a new loan is drawn down and message to be sent to borrower,  the activity generated would be SL-3103 meaning 3-LOAN, 1-INPUT, 0-OTHERS(since it involves all components) and 3-BORROWER.</p>
