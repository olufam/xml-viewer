            <p>On flagging CREATE.FACILITY field in PRESYNDICATION.FILE, appropriate            facility records are created in IHLD status.</p>
            <p>   Currently direct creation of facility record otherwise than through            Presyndication file is not permitted. Hence, the records created in            IHLD status cannot be deleted until first authorisation.</p>
            <p>   In the FACILITY file the bank may record details of type of credit            line, it validity in terms of drawings and maturity, the countries            of risk and exposure, the rate of commitment fee and its calculation            methodology, the rates and method of calculation of interest for            drawings under the line, details of participation and the            appropriate lending  rates applicable to each participant etc.</p>
            <p>   In the event that the bank desires to phase out disbursement, it            would be possible to break the facility into different tranches.            Both sequential and overlapping types of tranches may be defined. It            would be possible to record the details of participation at the            tranche level as well as other covenants like currencies in which            drawings are permissible and currencies prohibited, the validity of            the tranche, the customers who may draw under the tranche and the            amounts reserved and allowed to them, the maximum number of loans            and currrencies in which drawings are permissible under the tranche etc.</p>

<desc>
            <p>When a revolving facility is issued, the phased reduction of                    facility amounts could be defined in this set of fields.</p>
            <p>   For a non revolving facility, repayment schedules could be                    defined in SL.REPAYMENT.SCHEDULES table.</p>
            <p>   For a revolving facility, the facility amount could be                    reduced in a phased manner by using DEC.EFF.DT, DEC.AMOUNT                    and  DEC.PERC. Based on input in this set of fields an                    internal file called SL.EXPOSURE.LEVEL would be built.</p>
            <p>   When drawings are made, validations would be performed in                    order to check that the drawings does not breach the                    exposure levels. The following example would illustrate the functionality.</p>
            <p>   A facility is granted for 1,000,000 with value date as                    01JAN02, maturity date 01JAN05 with reductions as follows;</p>
            <p>   DEC.EFF.DT        DEC.AMOUNT        DEC.PERC</p>
            <p>   01JAN03                    250,000                    25%</p>

            <p>   Assume a single drawdown is made on value date 01JAN02 for                    the entire amount of 1,000,000. The latest maturity date                    that may be given for this drawing can be 31DEC02 as a                    decrease of 25% is contemplated on 01JAN03. If the borrower                    has made the drawing for 750,000 the latest maturity date                    that could be given is 31DEC03 as maximum exposure permitted                    beyond this date is 250,000 only.</p>
            <p>   In case the borrower has taken the loan (full value of                    1,000,000) for a shorter period, say with value date 01JAN02                    and maturity date 31OCT02. On this maturity date, there are                    two options open;</p>
            <p>   (a) To rollover the loan in full with maturity date less than 01JAN03</p>
            <p>   (b) To split the loan so that one or more loans aggregating                    to value 250,000 have maturity date less than 01JAN03 and                    one or more loans aggregating to value 750,000 having                    maturity date less than 01JAN04</p>
            <p>   On each Exposure Date, LIVECMT would be reversed out with an                    amount equal to Dec.Amount. If no input is made in                    Dec.Eff.Dt set of fields, LIVECMT should be reversed on the                    Maturity.Date for the full value. This is to ensure that the                    utilized amount under the Facility never exceeds the                    Exposure Level.</p>

            <p>   The amount that is mentioned in this field is reserved for                    the allowed customer and not available for others in the group.</p>
            <p>   Ex.; A, B, C are part of a</p>
            <p>   Conglomerate where A is the facility customer. A credit line                    of 1,000,000 is shared as follows;</p>
            <p />
            <p>   Customer        Reserved.amt        Allow.amt</p>
            <p />
            <p>   A                 250,000                    400,000</p>
            <p />

            <p />
            <p>   In this case the 'free float' in the facility is                    1,000,000 less the aggregate reserved amount of 650,000, ie,                    350,000. This 'free float' is usable on a first                    come basis subject to the allow amount not getting breached.                    In order to protect the reserved amount for others in the                    group, the allowed amount for a specific customer may not                    exceed the facility amount less the aggregate of reserved                    amount of all other customers. In this specific example, the                    allowed amount for A may not exceed 600,000 (1,000,000 less                    400,000 reserved for B and  C).</p>

For the later type, the transaction                    could involve a premium/discount paid/received by the buying bank.</p>
            <p>   This field is used to capture the consideration (grossed-up                    to include the contingent portion plus the premium/discount                    portion) for the transaction. The premium or discount could                    be either written directly to P&amp;L or amortised over the                    life of the Facility. The account from which the                    consideration is paid out is provided in Bs.Settle.Account.</p>

In such case SL.AMOUNT would show 1,000,000 and                    value to be input in Bs.Consideration field is 1,010,000.                    The decision to amortise or not is provided in                    Bs.Amortisation field. The accounting entries that would be                    raised are</p>

<field>LIQUIDATION.MODE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the manner in which overdue payments are handled.                    The default for all contracts is AUTOMATIC.</p>
            <p>   Two options are provided;</p>
            <p>   AUTOMATIC - When a commitment fee schedule is processed,                    accounting entries would be passed across the liquidation                    account for the entire dues and the respective                    participant's share would be disbursed through their                    Nostro accounts automatically. In this scenario, the Agent                    expects funds to be credited to his Nostro on the due dates                    and hence automates the liquidation and disbursement entries.</p>
            <p>   INTERNAL - In this scenario the Agent would pay the                    participants only on actual receipt of funds in his                    Nostro/liquidation account. The Agent's share (in case                    the Agent is also a participant) would be liquidated to the                    account provided in the deal for the respective due but no                    amounts would be disbursed to the participants. The overdue                    amounts would get captured in SL.OD.DUES and SL.OD.PART                    files. On receipt of funds, the application SL.OD.DUES may                    be used to pay off the participant's share as well as                    to reverse out own share in the internal account where                    Agent's share is stored.</p>
            <p>   In case the borrower has followed a different method of                    rounding with that compared to the Agent, the                    participant's share of interest, commitment fee and tax                    on both could differ. In such scenario the borrower would                    remit an amount different to the one calculated and stored                    by the Agent in his overdue files. Hence an application                    SL.ROUND.ADJ has been provided where the Agent could                    re-allocate the share of interest, commitment fee and tax                    thereon between the participants, to be in line with the                    borrower's calculation. This front-end could also be                    used in case the Agent does a skimming of the interest (on                    loans) or commitment fee. In this case the borrower is                    charged a different rate than the one quoted by the                    participants and the Agent skims the difference.</p>
            <p>   Liquidation mode INTERNAL could hence be used where ;</p>
            <p>   (a) The agent would repay the participants only on sighting                    the funds</p>
            <p>   (b) Where the agent would require to do rounding adjustments                    to re-allocate the participant's share</p>

<field>PRODUCT.TYPE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Indicates the product type. The module supports loan type products, Guarantees and Stand by Letter of Credits. Drawdown for loan type products is handled in this module. Issue of Guarantee or Stand by Letter of Credit under the facility is handled in MD module. This is enabled by  providing a link to the MD module by inputting the facility reference number in the MD deal. Though the processing of MD deal would be done by the MD module the management of facility would be handled in SL module.</p>
            <p> This field is a mutivalue field which can accept all the three defined values there by enabling the Facility to be utilised on any of the defined multiple products.</p>
            <p> This field has the Associated set of fields PRODUCT.AMT,PRODUCT.TR.CODE, PRODUCT.TR.AMT for defining multiple product utilisation for the facility amount under each tranche </p>
            <p> An example to define the Functionality </p>
            <p> The field PRODUCT.TYPE and PRODUCT.AMT is used to define the amount utilisation under the product and the associated sub-value fields PRODUCT.TR.CODE and PROD.TR.AMT is used to define the Tranche level utilisation on each Product.</p>
            <p> Consider a Total Facility amount of 100M with TR1 as 50M, TR2 as 30M and TR3 as 20M </p>
            <p> The PRODUCT.TYPE and PRODUCT.AMT can be defined as below</p>
            <p> LOANS USD 100M(LN-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M </p>
            <p> GTEES USD 100M(GT-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M </p>
            <p> SBLC's USD 100M(SC-PRODUCT)   TR1 50M, TR2 30M, TR3 20M , The tranche codes and amounts can be defined in PRODUCT.TR.CODE and PRODUCT.TR.AMT </p>
            <p> The above examples determines that a Facility of 100M can be utilised in the LN product type by a maximum of 50M utilisation from TR1, 30M from TR2 and 20M from TR3. Similarly for the GT and SC products. The amount utilisation is in the first come first serve basis and the utilisation on each product is allowed only on the outstanding tranche amount </p>
            <p>Allowed values in this field are LN, SC, GT, LCE and LCI.</p>
