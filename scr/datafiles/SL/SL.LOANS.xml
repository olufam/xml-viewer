            <p>A drawing under a facility could be in any allowed currency under the facility. The drawing could also be made by any allowed customer defined in the facility. At the time of each drawing checks are performed by the system to ensure that the drawing complies with the terms defined at the facility and tranche level.</p>
            <p>  Facility is available to the user to input amount of drawing in the drawing currency or base currency equivalent. Further features such as exchange rate fixing and interest rate fixing for forward dated drawings are also available.</p>
            <p>  Each drawing is identified against the tranche under which it is drawn and the individual participant's share in the tranche is updated by the system automatically. The share of participants in the drawing is defaulted by the system with an option to change the participant shares, if so required. The amounts due from individual participant at the time of drawdown and due to the individual participant on maturity is held and processed by the system automatically. Liquidation of amounts due from the borrower could follow an automatic route or through an internal account. If automatic route is chosen, on the due date the amounts due to individual participant is distributed. If internal option is chosen, distribution of funds to the participants could be done after the borrower has settled the dues. Separate front ends are available for settlement of dues after the liquidation date.</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>  Loans under syndication can be input with a value date that is less than today. However this can be done only in cases when it otherwise satisfies the normal input conditions of a Loan, viz., Validity of the Tranche under question, availability of funds under the Tranche, within the exposure level of each of the participants, etc. Impact of limit line and collection of any charges attached to this would be done as on the date of input of such a backdated Loan. In the case of commitment fee, the recalculation would be done for the current schedule.</p>
            <p>  To cater to instances such as undrawn commitment amount under the Tranche is less than the loan amount although the Tranche is live, the user has the option of input of SL.BUY.SELL, for Principal Movements that are backdated as well.</p>
            <p>  Principal Increase/Decrease in an existing undiscounted loan is permitted during the Tenor ranging between the value date and the maturity date of the Loan. The movement input shall however not conflict with the SL.EXPOSURE.LEVEL.</p>
            <p>  For Principal reduction, new participants would not be permitted, but such a decrease could result in exit of a participant. For Principal increase, new participants would be permitted provided such a participant is already recorded in the Tranche and has adequate share to participate.</p>
            <p>  If the loan were in a currency different from that of the Facility, then the impact of the Principal movements in the Facility would happen at the historic rate. Any adjustment of interest and commitment fee on account such principal movements would be confined to the current schedule only.</p>
            <p />
            <p>  Reversal function is restricted even if one schedule has been processed (or) Charges exist for the loan contract. In such cases where charges exist, reversal of charges should be done first before reversing the loan contract.</p>

<field>BASE.CCY.CONV</field>
<desc>
            <p>Conversion rate to be used for translation of loans/drawings to facility equivalent. When a loan is drawn under a facility in a currency different to the facility currency, the rate input in this field would used to translate the loan into facility currency equivalent. This would then be used to arrive at the amount available under the facility.</p>
            <p>  For example,</p>
            <p>  Sanctioned facility is USD 100 million. A GBP loan of 50 million is drawn against the facility. If the conversion rate is input as 1.5, the facility currency equivalent of the GBP loan would be USD 75 million. The facility would now have an available amount (undrawn amount) of USD 25 million. For a revolving facility when the loan matures, the available amount under the facility would be re-instated with an amount equal to the facility currency amount only (USD 75 million) irrespective of any movement in the GBP/USD exchange rate during this period.</p>

<field>LIQUIDATION.MODE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Identifies the manner in which overdue payments are handled. The default for all contracts is AUTOMATIC.</p>
            <p>  Two options are provided;</p>
            <p>  AUTOMATIC - On maturity of the loans (or while processing schedules), accounting entries would be passed across the liquidation account for the entire dues and the respective participant's share would be disbursed through their Nostro accounts automatically. In this scenario, the Agent expects funds to be credited to his Nostro on the due dates and hence automates the liquidation and disbursement entries.</p>
            <p>  INTERNAL - In this scenario the Agent would pay the participants only on actual receipt of funds in his Nostro/liquidation account. The Agent's share (in case the Agent is also a participant) would be liquidated to the account provided in the deal for the respective due but no amounts would be disbursed to the participants. The overdue amounts would get captured in SL.OD.DUES and SL.OD.PART files. On receipt of funds, the application SL.OD.DUES may be used to pay off the participant's share as well as to reverse out own share in the internal account where Agent's share is stored.</p>
            <p>  In case the borrower has followed a different method of rounding with that compared to the Agent, the participant's share of interest, commitment fee and tax on both could differ. In such scenario the borrower would remit an amount different to the one calculated and stored by the Agent in his overdue files. Hence an application SL.ROUND.ADJ has been provided where the Agent could re-allocate the share of interest, commitment fee and tax thereon between the participants, to be in line with the borrower's calculation. This front-end could also be used in case the Agent does a skimming of the interest (on loans) or commitment fee. In this case the borrower is charged a different rate than the one quoted by the participants and the Agent skims the difference.</p>
            <p>  Liquidation mode INTERNAL could hence be used where ;</p>
            <p>  (a) The agent would repay the participants only on sighting the funds</p>
            <p>  (b) Where the agent would require to do rounding adjustments to re-allocate the participant's share</p>

<field>EXCG.FIX.DT</field>
<desc>
            <p>Date on which exchange rate between facility currency and loan currency is to be determined.</p>
            <p>  While granting forward dated loans in a currency other than the facility currency, the exchange rate at which the drawing would get converted to base currency equivalent would be determined few days before the value date. Such date is input in this field.</p>
            <p>  A tentative rate is provided in Base.Ccy.Conv field that would be used for updation of facility and limit. On the exchange rate fixing date, the final rate is provided by the user. This rate would be used to update the facility and limit and the earlier updations dropped.</p>
            <p>  Ex. Facility is for USD 100,000 and Loan is granted for GBP 10,000 on 01JAN02 with following inputs</p>
            <p>  Value date = 12JAN02, Base.Ccy.Conv = 1.40, Excg.Fix.Dt 10JAN02</p>
            <p>  On 01st Jan the initial rate of 1.40 would be used and the commitment available amount would get reduced by 14,000 (10,000 * 1.40) to stand at 86,000. On 10th Jan the final rate provided in Excg.Fix.Dt is 1.5. Now this rate would be used to update the facility and hence the new commitment available amount would be 85,000 ie. 86,000 + 14,000(updated earlier) - 15,000 (current update of 10,000 * 1.5).</p>
            <p>  Two entries to LIVECMT asset type would be raised for the above example, one for 15,000 (new value) and one for 14,000 (old value)</p>
            <p>  While providing the new exchange rate, error would be shown if the new rate results in overdrawing the commitment available amount. In this case the user may alter the AMOUNT field by reducing the value of the loan. On such action, the accounting entries for asset type FORWARDDB would be raised dropping the old amount and raising the new amount. Limit, facility balances and participant balances files will be rebuilt for such change.</p>

            <p>  Each of the 4 digits are arrived at as below :</p>
            <p>  The first digit indicates the application for which the activity has been generated. Presently it has three values  viz. 1 -  PRE    2 - FACILITY and  3 - SL.LOAN</p>
            <p>  The second digit indicates the operation done under each application.  Presently it has six values viz.       0 - OTHERS     1 - INPUT     2 - AMENDMENT     3 - NOTICE      4 - CONFIRMATION           5 - REVERSAL</p>
            <p>  The third digit indicates the component for which the message is being generated viz. Principal or Interest or commitment fee etc.  Presently it has five values viz.   0 - OTHERS   1 - PRINCIPAL                         2 - COMMITMENT FEE     3 - INTEREST     4 - CHARGES</p>
            <p>  The fourth digit indicates to whom the message is being generated, whether to the participant or to the borrower  or  to both.  Presently it has three values viz.  1 -  PARTICIPANT ONLY                             2 - PARTICIPANT AND BORROWER    3 - BORROWER ONLY</p>
            <p>  For example when a new loan is drawn down and message to be sent to borrower,  the activity generated would be SL-3103 meaning 3-LOAN, 1-INPUT, 0-OTHERS(since it involves all components) and 3-BORROWER.</p>
