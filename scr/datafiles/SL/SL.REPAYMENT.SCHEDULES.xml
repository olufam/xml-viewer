            <p>SL.EXPOSURE.LEVEL file would be built where SL.REPAYMENT.SCHEDULES is defined at Facility level. Updation would happen as follows;</p>
            <p>Exposure Date  Whould start with RPT.START.DATE and have one value for every cycled date.</p>
            <p>Exposure Level  This would contain the projected exposure. First updation would be for amount equal to Facility amount less principal amount expected to be repaid on the scheduled date. This updation would go on till the repayment end date when the Exposure level would become zero.</p>
            <p />
            <p>When a fresh loan is drawn or while handling SL.ROLLOVER, error would be produced when Exposure level is exceeded.</p>
            <p />
            <p>Example - If the build is SL.EXPOSURE.LEVEL is as follows (based on definition in SL.REPAYMENT.SCHEDULES)</p>
            <p>Exposure Date  01 Jan 05</p>
            <p>Exposure Level  75,000</p>
            <p>Exposure Date  01 Jan 06</p>
            <p>Exposure Level  60,000</p>
            <p>Exposure Date  01 Jan 07</p>
            <p>Exposure Level  10,000</p>
            <p>Exposure Date  01 Jan 08</p>
            <p>Exposure Level  0</p>
            <p />
            <p>Assume that two loans exist under the Facility  L1 for 40,000 and L2 for 60,000, both amounts expressed in BCCY equivalent (The loans could exist in any currency). The current maturity date in L1 and L2 are 31 Oct 04. When an attempt is made to rollover L1 for a further period of 6 months (till 31 Mar 05), this would go through. If L2 is rolled over for a similar period, error message is to be produced as the projected exposure level on 01 Jan 05 is exceeded. The borrower could in this case split L2 into two loans, one for 25,000 each, with maturity date as 31 Dec 05 and 31 Mar 05.</p>
