            <p>DATA.CAPTURE creates via the T24 accounting routines, entries on the new file DC.ENTRY.  Each entry is uniquely identified by date and DATA.CAPTURE batch number, and consists of pointers to STMT.ENTRY and CATEG.ENTRY records that have been created by DATA.CAPTURE. </p>
            <p>The pointers contained in DC.ENTRY consist of standard STMT.ENTRY and CATEG.ENTRY identifiers prefixed by 'S' or 'C' to distinguish which of the two files the entries are on.  DC.ENTRY records can be viewed, listed and printed. </p>
            <p>The DC.ENTRY file is supported by two enquiries, DATA.CAPTURE.JOURNAL and TXN.ENTRY. </p>
            <p>DATA.CAPTURE.JOURNAL displays details of STMT.ENTRY and CATEG.ENTRY records with batch and entry totals.  TXN.ENTRY displays details of transactions given the DATA.CAPTURE batch number and date. </p>
            <p>The contents of DC.ENTRY for a particular day are reported, via the inclusion of EB.PRINT in EOD.DATA.CAPTURE, using DATA.CAPTURE.JOURNAL to produce the report. </p>
            <p>Items on the DC.ENTRY file are retained for three months.  DC.PURGE clears old items when run in EOD.DATA.CAPTURE. </p>
