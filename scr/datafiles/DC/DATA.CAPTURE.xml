            <p>This Application allows banking areas to pass debit and credit transactions to all Customer Accounts, Internal (General) Accounts and Profit and Loss Accounts maintained within T24.  It is used to capture all entries which do not justify a transaction processing system (e.g. recording of business travel expenses) or for which an automated system is not yet available. </p>
            <p>An entry may be assigned to a specific Batch Number by the Batch User, or, alternatively, a Batch Number can be assigned automatically.  A Batch can contain a variety of Profit and Loss, Internal Account and Customer Account entries and any mixture of local currency and foreign currency transactions.  Each Batch must balance on the local currency amounts and the End of Day processing of the Application will automatically generate a difference entry if this is not the case. </p>
            <p>All entries must be input in the Currency of the related Account. For foreign currency entries, when a specific Exchange Rate is not input, a Middle Rate will be used to generate the local currency equivalent. </p>
            <p>When Profit and Loss entries are input either the Customer number or an Account Officer code must be included. It is recommended that a Customer number is input as this provides improved MIS reporting. </p>
            <p>As each entry is input, it will be validated on- line.  Error conditions must be corrected immediately and warning messages overridden, otherwise the entry must be abandoned or held.  After successful Validation of each entry, the Batch balance is updated and a new total displayed in the header section of the screen.  The header shows debit and credit totals for local and foreign currency, the foreign totals being shown in local currency equivalent. </p>
            <p>The status of the Batch can be checked using the Exception and List displays.  A Batch will show the status INAU (input but not Authorised) until the Batch is balanced.  This is the case even when all items in the Batch have been Authorised.  The status may be requested at a detailed Batch level (by input of a Batch Number), at a Summary Department level (by input of a Department code), or as an overall Batch display (by input of ALL after the function).  Input of the List Function with no further parameters provides a summary display of all Batches for the Department of the User.  Each Batch will then be displayed on one line.  Input of 'L' against one Batch on this display leads to a display of all entries of the selected Batch in the form of one line per entry.  Input of 'S' against one or more items on the display leads to a detailed display of the selected entries.  These can be shown in sequence by pressing Function Key F5. </p>
            <p>Entries can be deleted prior to Authorisation using the Delete function. </p>
            <p>A Batch is Authorised either by individual Item Number (by input of a Batch Number and an Item Number), by individual Item within Batch (by input of a Batch Number), or as an entire Batch (by input of a Batch Number followed by ALL).  When Summary Authorisation is being carried out (ALL has been specified), details of individual entries will not be shown.  When a Batch is in balance and has been Authorised, it may not be amended and further entries cannot be added to the Batch. </p>
            <p>The Reversal Function (R) is not available within the Data Capture Application.  Following Authorisation, an entry can only be reversed by the input of a new entry which has the Reversal Marker set.  The second entry may be part of the same Batch as the original (if the Batch is not yet in balance and fully Authorised) or input to a different Batch.  There is no link between the two entries. </p>
            <p>During the End of Day Processing, all entries which have not been Authorised are replaced by Suspense entries.  The Internal Account number to be used for these entries is obtained by reference to records identified as SUSPENSE on the ACCOUNT.CLASS file (Ref: General Tables). Additionally, a balancing entry is generated if a Batch is found to be out of balance.  The Internal Account number for this is found by reference to a record identified as DIFFERENCE on the ACCOUNT.CLASS file.  Transaction codes used for balancing entries are 98 for CREDIT and 99 for DEBIT. </p>
            <p>These transaction codes need to be loaded on the TRANSACTION table (Ref: General Tables).  A special entry number '999' has been reserved for this purpose and will be used when a difference entry is generated by the system. </p>
            <p>Special care must be taken when entering items for Contingent Accounts. These should be input in separate Batches containing only contingent entries. </p>
            <p>The Print Function (P) can be used to print details of individual entries.  P may be entered either as a  Function i.e. Data Capture P 0001 001 001 or against one or more of the entries shown when an individual batch is L(isted). </p>
            <p>By means of the VERSION Application (Ref: Utilities), different screens may be defined for specific requirements.  For example, one screen could be designed to process clearing cheques, another to process transfers in local currency etc. </p>

<field>EXCHANGE.RATE</field>
<desc>
            <p>Specifies the Exchange Rate to local currency. </p>
            <p>If not input for a foreign currency entry, the System uses a Currency Market Indicator to derive an Exchange Rate from the CURRENCY file. The System first checks for the presence of CURRENCY.MARKET on the entry itself. If not present, the System uses the Currency Market indicator specified on the Account record of the Account input in ACCOUNT.NUMBER. </p>
            <p>The Exchange Rate is used to calculate the Local Currency Equivalent or, if this has been input, to verify the value of the Local Currency Equivalent. </p>
            <p>When the AMOUNT.LCY equivalent has been entered the input of the exchange rate is mandatory, unless the CURRENCY entered is the local currency and the transaction is a Profit or Loss transaction, when no input is allowed in this field. </p>
            <p>As most DATA.CAPTURE. transactions do not involve exchange profit, the Currency Middle Rate will be used as a default for foreign currency entries when no other exchange rate has been input. </p>
            <p>1-12 type R (Standard Rate Format - up to 8 integer and 6 decimal) characters plus a decimal point or 1-15 type R (Up to 8 integer and 9 decimal) characters plus a decimal point when EXTENDED.PREC in SPF is set to &amp;#145;Y&amp;#146;.</p>
            <p>If not input, a default value will be derived. If the Exchange Rate is input, the System will use the Middle Exchange Rate for the appropriate CURRENCY.MARKET for comparison. If the input is not equal to the Middle Rate, the System will then check that the Rate is within a specified percentage tolerance. The percentage figure for this check is to be found in DEFAULT.RATE.ALLOWANCE on the COMPANY record. </p>

These local elements should be defined by the User where deemed necessary according to local practice. </p>
            <p>The name of the new element(s), as well as the Format and <p>Validation Rules:</p>, must be defined in the Local Tables and LOCAL.REF Table prior to their use in the DATA.CAPTURE Application. </p>

            <p>For debit entries to Customer Accounts, the System will also check if funds are available (by reference to the Working Balance of the Account record).  If funds are not available in the Working Balance, the System will check if an Overdraft Limit exists.  If there is no Limit or if the Limit would be exceeded by application of the entry, an override is necessary.  For further information, refer to the Help Text on LIMITs. </p>

            <p>It is recommended that, for Profit and Loss entries, the CUSTOMER.ID is entered rather than this field, as the quality of MIS reporting is then improved. </p>

            </p>
            <p>If the foreign currency Amount does not agree with the local currency amount when divided (or multiplied) by the Exchange Rate, the System then refers to FCY.CONV.TOLER.MIN and FCY.CONV.TOLER.MAX on the COMPANY record to determine if the Amounts input are within an acceptable tolerance. If the equivalent of the foreign currency differs from the local currency by less than the FCY.CONV.TOLER.MIN, the entry is accepted. If the difference is greater than the FCY.CONV.TOLER.MAX, an error message "NN.NN CONVERSION DIFF" is displayed and either the local or the foreign currency Amount (or both) must be adjusted before the entry will be accepted. If the difference is between FCY.CONV.TOLER.MIN and FCY.CONV.TOLER.MAX, then an override is required. </p>
            <p>See also EXCHANGE.RATE for rate tolernace checking information.</p>
