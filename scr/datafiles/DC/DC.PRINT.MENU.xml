            <p>For the ease of the user, the Data Capture application allows printing during the on-line session batches of transactions which have been processed earlier during the day.  When requesting this facility, the user will be presented with a menu screen where he will need to specify to the following parameters: </p>
            <p>1) Department </p>
            <p>   Here he can specify one specific department for which he wants to print    some batch or any range of departments. </p>
            <p>2) Batch No </p>
            <p>   In this parameter, the user can specify a specific batch or again a    range of batches. </p>
            <p>3) Item No </p>
            <p>   To specify a specific item number or again a range of items. </p>
            <p>4) Amount Greater </p>
            <p>   Finally, the user can also specify that he only wants to print the    transactions with an amount greater than the one specified in this    parameter. </p>
            <p>When the user did specify all his parameters, the system will prompt a message asking him to confirm that the parameters are correct.  Once the confirmation has been given, the Data Capture application will then print the batch(es) according to the value of the 4 parameters. </p>
