            <p>The 'raw' data in the directory XT.DATA.FEEDS is not in a file format that is of any use to InfoBasic programs. Make Keys reads this data and converts it to two Information files, the Keys file, which holds the unique identity of each record and its mapping status and any error information (updated during Match &amp; Map, then next procedure), and the Source Recs file, which holds the data itself, with each data element held as a field. There is a separate pair of files for each source - they are named as F.XT.KEYS.Name, and F.XT.SOURCE.RECS.Name, where Name is the name of the specified Source. </p>
            <p>The id of each record contains the time and date, so it is possible to run many update tapes (for example) without fear of overwriting previous information. </p>
            <p>Each record id is displayed on the screen as it is processed. </p>
