            <p>This module outputs to external sources. At present, the AIBD are the only receivers of data from the system on a regular basis. An extract file is the input to the module (defined in XT.FILE.CONCATS for AIBDOUT as DS.AIBD.OUT), and the mapping and conversion are performed as defined in XT.RECORD.DEFS for the source. </p>
            <p>The formatted data is then sent directly to the source. For the AIBD, this involves instructions on dialling and the use of modems appearing on the screen for operators to follow. </p>
