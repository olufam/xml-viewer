            <p>This module is the core of the External Feeds input system. Each record in the appropriate KEYS file is read, and if this record has already been mapped, or marked for deletion, then the KEYS and SOURCE.RECS records are deleted. If not, then this key is passed to the matching and mapping routines. </p>
            <p>How new or existing records are handled depends on the source being processed - </p>
            <p>EXBOND      If this is a BUILD from scratch, then the            files are assumed empty. So all records are            created as new, with the security number            auto generated from the file XT.NEXT.ID. </p>
            <p>           If not a BUILD then if a record already            exists on the $NAU file the updating record            is not processed (as it overwrites an            existing user change, or if the XT.SOURCE            definition says to update the live file,            this will get overwritten by the            authorisation of this $NAU record). If the            security cannot be accessed via its Exbond            code, then we assume that this because            although the security is on the system, the            Exbond code was not entered. Thus we do            nothing but report to the user, who puts            the now known Exbond code on the Security. </p>
            <p>AIBD If there is no security of that AIBD number, the     records are deleted, else the input file     (XT.PRICE.IN) is updated with a key of security     code with '.AIBD' appended. </p>
            <p>For each field of the incoming record, XT.RECORD.DEFS defines what special routines are to be performed, how the data is to be converted in format, how to perform the translation between incoming and outgoing values, and to which fields of which files the data is to be written. </p>
            <p>Any errors in the above processes are reported to a printed log, and also stored against the erroneous id in the XT.KEYS.Name file (where Name is the name of the specified source). This log also prints successful updates and creations. </p>
