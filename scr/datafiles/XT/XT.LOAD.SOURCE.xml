            <p>This loads the data from the input source, either from tape, or from the RJ 3780 subsystem. The resultant file is stored in the subdirectory XT.DATA.FEEDS with the name the same as the source name, ie there will be a file per input source in this directory. </p>
            <p>The program uses the appropriate Primos utilities to load the data for a specified source. Note that if the source arrives via a tape, the tape MUST be loaded and the tape unit assigned before this job is run. For AIBD, which uses the RJ 3780 subsystem, the operator is given instructions regarding the modem and telephone numbers. </p>
