    <overview>
        <ovdesc>
            <p>Payoff property class is used to produce pay off statement which is a document prepared by the bank and given to the customer when a loan payoff is considered. It shows the current status of the loan account, all sums due and the daily rate of interest. It is also referred to as  “Letter of Demand”. Additionally a per-diem amount is also shown in the statement - the daily interest amount is charged additionally until the pay-off statement expires.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>   The payoff amounts would be calculated using simulation framework.</p>
