            <p>The CLOSURE property class is used to Close an AA account if no more transactions happen in that account.In case of non-revolving arrangements, once all balances are settled, Arrangement account Closure can be triggered anytime manually or automatically. For revolving arrangements, the activity can be triggered on or after maturity. On reversal of a new arrangement, account closure would be triggered automatically.</p>

                <p>This field specifies the period after which closure activity needs to be scheduled once the arrangement account is identified for closure. (Based on closure Method and Closure type settings).                     This field will not be considered if close activity is triggered manually.

                <p>If CLOSURE.PERIOD is NULL , Close activity would be scheduled on the date in which all balances are settled.                           </p>
