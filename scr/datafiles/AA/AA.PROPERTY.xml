            <p>While the Property Classes define the fundamental building blocks, a more specific classification 

is necessary to fully describe a product.  For example a loan product may require more than one type of “Interest” 

(i.e. “normal interest” and “penalty interest”).  To satisfy this requirement the Product Builder has a concept of 

a Property which is a named type of Property Class.  </p>
            <p>       Example Properties of the “Interest” class would be “principal interest”, “penalty 

interest”, “credit interest”, “debit interest”, etc.  Each of these Properties would share a common set of 

characteristics and processing.  It is in fact these lower level Properties to which defined conditions (i.e. 

specific interest rates) are attached in order to create the products that are available for sale.</p>
            <p />
            <p>      While the Property Classes are defined and released by Temenos, the underlying Properties are 

created and maintained by users.  Any number of Properties can be defined providing an extremely powerful and 

flexible means of creating new innovative products.  For example if a product type was desired that required three 

separate interest rates with different calculation methods the user would simply create (or reuse) the three 

Properties of an “Interest” Property Class.</p>
            <p>      Once the necessary Properties have been created, the designer can use them to define a 

Product Group by specifying the mandatory and optional Properties which comprise it.  </p>

<field>SYSTEM.PROPERTY</field>

            <p>Certain properties are released by Temenos for mapping the existing parameter tables from AA 

product conditions. A value of YES in this field would indicate that it is a property used for such purposes.</p>

<field>PROPERTY.TYPE</field>
<desc>
         <p>The options are NULL, PRODUCT.ONLY, SUSPEND, SUSPEND.OVERDUES, ACCRUAL.BY.BILLS, CREDIT, 

RESIDUAL.ACCRUAL, FORWARD DATED, VARIATION, COMMISSION and REBATE UNAMORTISED. </p>
        <p>PRODUCT.ONLY - If this is selected, the details for this Property are defined only at product level and 

cannot be viewed or edited at arrangement level. For example for properties which use ACCOUNTING class, it is 

highly unlikely that the user would need to define or modify accounting rules for each arrangement. Hence defining 

them at the product would suffice. </p>
        <p>SUSPEND - If this is selected, it would mean that the property would be allowed to suspend. Only 

INTEREST and CHARGE properties can be suspend.</p>
        <p>SUSPEND.OVERDUE - If this is defined, it would mean that any overdues in the property will also be 

suspended when property is suspend. To define SUSPEND.OVERDUE, the property should already be set to SUSPEND.</p>
        <p conditions="FROMRELEASE.R13">ACCRUAL.BY.BILLS – If selected,it performs accrual update in bills.</p>
      <p>CREDIT - This is to state that the property Needs to raise Credit entry or Debit entry. Default type is 

Debit.If CREDIT is specified for charge then it will be considered as bonus.</p>
        <p>RESIDUAL ACCRUAL - This is to make difference between the TOT.ACCR.AMT and the Amount made due to move 	

                              under RES balance type.</p>
         <p>FORWARD DATED - This is introduced to display future dated conditions.</p>
        <p>VARIATION - This is stated so that proofing would check for the existence of variations            

(GOLD/PLATINUM/INTERNET).Rules to check whether customers are satisfied these variations will be             

defined in eligibility condition.</p>
         <p>REBATE UNAMORTISED - Normal charges without property type as “REBATE.UNAMORT” can be set to amortize. 

When an arrangement with such a charge definition is paid off, it should recognise the unamortised amount 

immediately, without depending on the configuration in payment schedule</p>
         <p>COMMISSION -  This is introduced to identify charges those are used as commissions. </p>    </desc>

            <p>The prefix to be used to create the new AC.BALANCE.TYPE record. AA provides flexibility for the 

user to create their own properties and the balances that are linked to those properties. To create balances the 

standard prefix defined for the class of this property is defaulted here.</p>
