            <p />
            <p>    This property may be used for specifying the restrictions on a particular transaction. Along with Periodic attributes, restrictions could also be applied based on the nature of the transaction. &amp;apos;Only 5 repayments are allowed within a month&amp;apos; or &amp;apos;Repayments can only be in multiples of 1000s&amp;apos; are typical examples of transaction rules using periodic attributes. The following AA.PERIODIC.ATTRIBUTE.CLASS records may be utilised for specifying transaction rules</p>
            <p />
            <p> It is possible to restrict only one single activity on one activity restriction record</p>
