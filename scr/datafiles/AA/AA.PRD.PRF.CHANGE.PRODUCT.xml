<ovdesc>

            <p>The CHANGE.PRODUCT Property Class is used by all products which allow for a change of product during their lifecycle. When a new product is applied onto the existing arrangement, the user would lose all his negotiations done as part of the old product. This table allows a list of products to which the old product can change and also define time-scales as to when the event would happen. </p>
            <p />
            <p>         There are some property classes which do not apply onto the arrangement when the change product happens. Currently these are : TERM.AMOUNT, CUSTOMER, ACCOUNT and LIMIT classes. The properties of these classes would continue with their running conditions and would not be affected by change product event.</p>
