<field>HIGHEST.RANGE</field>
<desc>
            <p>This field should be read along with the field AMT.PERCENT.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     Input in this field indicates the product is RANGED Revolving type. It is a multi value set. The field Highest Range can take only amount which implies the range. Each drawals is taken and is matched with the range within which it falls. The %age or the amount specified in the range under amt. percent field is applied to arrive at the CC amount.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     REVOLVING.RATIO</p>
            <p>     *10%</p>
            <p />
            <p>     HIGHEST.RANGE</p>
            <p>     100000</p>
            <p />
            <p>     AMT.PERCENT</p>
            <p>     B*100</p>
            <p />
            <p>     HIGHEST.RANGE</p>
            <p>     300000</p>
            <p />
            <p>     AMT.PERCENT</p>
            <p>     *10</p>
            <p />
            <p>     HIGHEST.RANGE</p>
            <p>     500000</p>
            <p />
            <p>     AMT.PERCENT</p>
            <p>     250000</p>
            <p />
            <p />
            <p>     (1) A '*', before the numeric entered in AMT.PERCENT is must or else the system will deem it as amount and will generate CC schedule for only USD10 and not 10% of the outstanding.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     (2) A 'B*100', implies '100% of the balance in the acct'. This is because when the outstanding in a sub acct falls within this range then it is obvious that as per the minimum class an amount of 100000 is payable. However, if the outstanding in the acct is 98573 in that case CC schedule amount will be more than the outstanding that is actually payable if we stick to the concept of 100000 minimum. To obviate this we have introduced the concept 100% of the balance outstanding or 100000.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     (3) The fields Highest Range and Amt. Percent can be multi valued to specify different ranges. Amt. Percent field can be input either with a %age or an amount. A sub acct indicating a draw down is taken and is matched for a range within which it falls and the %age specified in the amt. percent field for that range is applied. If the AMT.PERCENT field contains an amount the system doesn't calculate any %age, but takes the amount as the 'CC' amount.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     For ex:</p>
            <p>     (1) Reference to the table, if the amount of draw down in a sub a/c comes to 250000 then it falls within the range of 300000 hence attracts 10% of the range as the 'CC' amount.</p>
            <p>     (2) Similarly, if the draw down in a sub a/c comes to 500000 then it attracts a flat amount of 250000 instead of any % age since the AMT.PERCENT field contains an amount.</p>
            <p>     (3) If the draw down in a sub a/c comes to 600000, since there is no range within which it falls it automatically attracts the revolving %age for generation of 'CC' schedule amount, which in the present case (refer table) will be 10%.</p>
            <p />

            <p>     For a Non Redemption type, input in this field is mandatory. This is for the reason that in Non Redemption type CI (interest) schedules are generated regularly and the Principal (CC schedules) repayment is made in one BULLET payment.</p>
