        <p>(Optional and Only Valid if method is "Automatic")</p>
        <p>This provides the option for the system to periodically check that the client is still on the best plan taking into account any changes that may have been made to any of the plans for which the client is eligible.  This will be an EOD process.</p>

        <p>
            <p value="1">Automatic - The rules in this property will determine the pricing plan to apply.</p>
            <p value="2">Automatic or Manual - Similar to automatic, but it allows a user to manually override this by assigning a plan manually.  Please note than in case a manually assigned plan is no longer available during a plan reset, the arrangement will go back to automatically choosing a plan.</p>
            <p value="3">None - No plan will be selected and none can be entered manually.  Relationship pricing will not apply to the arrangement.</p>

<field>PLAN.SELECT.PROPERTY</field>
<desc>
        <p>If "Best" is specified as the type, this specifies which arrangement interest property (e.g. DEPOSITINT) will be compared across eligible arrangements to determine which plan to select (i.e. which is best) following the following rules:</p>
        <p>
            <p value="1">Credit Interest - biggest increase</p>
            <p value="2">Debit Interest - biggest rate decrease</p>
        </p>
        <p>This is currently restricted to interest properties.</p>
        <p>Additionally, if two or more plans are "equal" then the system will automatically choose the more recent of the pricing arrangements.</p>
        <p>
            <p value="1">Should be a valid AA.PROPERTY belonging to INTEREST class.</p>
            <p value="2">It is an input-field only if the PLAN.SELECT.TYPE is BEST</p>
            <p value="3">Mandatory if the PLAN.SELECT.TYPE is BEST</p>

<t>
<field>PLAN.SELECT.TYPE</field>
<desc>
        <p>If "Automatic" is specified as the method, this field denotes the type of automatic selection that will be done.</p>
        <p>
            <p value="1">Best - will use the best plan based on a single interest property.  Please note that in case that there is more than one pricing arrangement with an identical "best" benefit, the system will choose the one which was established most recently.</p>
            <p value="2">Priority - will use the predefined priority order to choose amongst multiple eligible plans.</p>
            <p value="3">Routine - will allow for a user-defined routine to select an appropriate plan.</p>
            <p value="4">Mandatory, if method is not set to "None"</p>
