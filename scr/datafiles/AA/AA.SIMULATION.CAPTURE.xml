            <p>The application AA.SIMULATION.CAPTURE allows the user to capture any activity for simulation on a existing arrangement or simulate a new arrangement</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The field structure is similar to AA.ARRANGEMENT.ACTIVITY.</p>
            <p>The list of activities than can be simulated for a given arrangement falling under a given product line is available in the application AA.ACTIVITY.For new arrangements the only activity available is &quot;New Arrangement&quot;. The user must input Customer and Product desired. For financial products the currency is also required.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The user can amend the property conditions depending on the rule type.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Using this application the user can capture, simulate and directly execute the required activity</p>

                <p>Unique id to identify the record in AA.ARRANGEMENT.ACTIVITY. The ID can be in any of the following formats,</p>
                <p/>
                <p> When the record is requested for an Activity which is required very often like &quot;Accrue Interest&quot; activity, rather than generating a new sequence everytime, system does the activity on the same id everytime, by just modifying the content of Arrangement activity. The Id is of the format:</p>
                <p> &lt;ARRANGEMENT.ID&gt;-&lt;INTEREST.PROPERTY&gt;-ACCRUAL</p>
                <p> Where ACCRUAL is the keyword.</p>
                <p/>
                <p> For all other events, a unique ID is generated with the following format - AAACT YYDDD XXXXXXXX, </p>
