<ovdesc>

            <p>The purpose of this table is to specify the next date and subsequent frequency of application of debit and credit interest, for a group of Accounts.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   Interest may be applied any day of the month. Cycles may be different for debit and credit interest, (e.g. debit interest may be charged monthly and credit interest paid quarterly) unless credit interest is only to be calculated as an offset to debit interest.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   The date of debit interest application is also used as the date of application of Interest Related Charges. (These are Debit Interest Addon, Government Margin, Highest Debit and Interest Statement charges.)</p>
            <p />
            <p>   If the 'Last Day Inclusive' field in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL file contains 'Y', interest is calculated on balances with value up to and including the capitalisation date. The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the capitalisation date.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   If 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'NO' only balances up to and including the previous working day are included. The value date of the interest entry booked is the day after the last balance included.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   Interest entries are booked to the Customer Account on the day they are calculated, or on the next working day, depending on the Application Posting Day specified in the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record. If the capitalisation date falls on a non-working day, the application is processed on the previous working day, unless 'Last Day Inclusive' contains 'Y' and a month end accrual day falls before the capitalisation date, in which case the application is processed on the next working day. In either case, the calculation is up to the capitalisation date and the entries generated have the same value date as they would have had if they had been processed on that date.</p>

<field>DR2.CAP.FREQUENCY</field>

            <p />
            <p>   Mnndd (Every nn months on the dd day) If today's date is less than dd, the next date is day dd in nn months from last month, otherwise it is day dd in nn months form the current month. If this date does not exist (e.g. 30th February) the previous day is assumed (28th or 29th February).</p>

            <p>   Note:</p>
            <p />
            <p>   (i) When the date specified, or calculated by the System falls on a non-working day, the application is processed on the previous working day (or the next working day if 'Last Day Inclusive' = 'Y' and a month end accrual day falls before the date specified), calculating figures up to the date specified.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   (ii) If Daily application frequency is specified, and the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record specifies that interest is calculated on balances including the capitalisation date (Last Day Inclusive = Y), separate entries are generated for each day, including non-working days.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   (iii) In the above case, if the ACCOUNT.ACCRUAL record specifies that interest is booked to the Account on the next working day (Application Posting Day = NEXT), the entries generated before a weekend or other non-working day will cause automatic back-value corrections on the next working day.</p>

            <p />
            <p>   For example if the end of the month is Friday 31st and the first working day of the next month is Monday the 3rd, then any accounts set for capitalisation on the first or second of the month will be capitalised in the start of day processing of the COB starting on Friday 31st. If the account is not set for start of day capitalisation then the accounts due for capitalisation on the first or second will be capitalised during the EOD processing of the COB starting on Monday 3rd.</p>
            <p />
            <p>   In a situation where the next working day is 1 day after the period end of the EOD portion of the COB accounts will be capitalised during the EOD processing of the COB running on the capitalisation date even if the account is set for start of day capitalisation. For example COB begins on Friday 15th, Period end is Sunday 17th, next working day is Monday 18th, then accounts set for start of day capitalisation and with a capitalisation date of the 18th will be capitalised in the EOD processing of the COB starting on the 18th.</p>
