                <p>When charges are to be calculated based on activity count, this attribute acts as threshold for the number of times an activity is performed. Calculation based on TIER.COUNT is linked to definition in AA.SOURCE.CALC.TYPE file. If the source balance for a charge is linked to a record in AA.SOURCE.CALC.TYPE which has the definition SOURCE.TYPE set to ACTIVITY and CALC.TYPE set to COUNT, then those charges are eligible to be calculated based on activity count.</p>
                <p>Validation Rules:</p>
                <p>It is possible to specify either TIER.AMOUNT or TIER.COUNT. Both cannot be specified simultaneously.</p>
