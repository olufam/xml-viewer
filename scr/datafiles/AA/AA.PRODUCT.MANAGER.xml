            <p>The AA.PRODUCT.MANAGER application will allow selection of:</p>
            <p>     • Product</p>
            <p>     • The action on the Product - Like PROOF, PUBLISH etc</p>
            <p>     • Available Date for the product</p>
            <p>     • Expiry date of the product</p>
            <p>     The product manager is the only way that an action can take place on a product. An action can be performed on any level of a product family.</p>
            <p />
            <p>     When a proofing or publishing action is performed on a product the same action will automatically take place on the child products too. Publishing and Proofing will perform processing from parent down to all children. The hierarchy will be resolved using the published product definitions.</p>
            <p>     The Proofing and Publishing process will result in the creation of product specific property condition records.</p>

<field>PRODUCT.VERSION</field>
<desc>
            <p>The version that this product is running on. This field is updated by the system and would be incremented by 0.1 for every action that the user performs on the product. It starts with 0.0 and the first proofing process would update to 0.1. Subsequent proofing/Cancel proofing action would increment it by 0.1. When the product is successfully published, it moves to the next whole number. In this case, when the product is published successfully, the version would move to 1.0. Further processing on this product would update version to 1.1, 1.2 etc.</p>

            <p>Errors(if any) during the Proofing and Publishing process are updated in this multi-value set. If there are multiple errors during the process, system would update all errors in the multi-value fields. It is expected that the user would monitor these errors and take corrective steps on the errors shown.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    These errors would be cleared when the user has taken the right corrective action.</p>

<t>
<field>ACTION</field>
<desc>
            <p>The action that is being performed on this product. When a product has been completely designer, it undergoes a process called Publishing which comprises of actions at various levels. The following are the various options:</p>
            <p />
            <p>    1. PROOF - The product has been designed and reacy to be proofed. This is the first step in any publishing process and performs the following tasks:</p>
            <p>                 • Expands the product definition to include the inherited property definitions from the published parent product</p>
            <p>                 • Ensures that the resolved product definition includes all mandatory properties identified in the Product Group definition.</p>
            <p>    • Ensures that conditions exist for each property condition linked to a product.</p>
            <p>    • Ensures that a currency condition exists for each allowed currency for the product.</p>
            <p>    • Cross-validates product property conditions to ensure consistency and avoid conflicting values</p>
            <p />
            <p>    Product proofing will use the current Product Designer definitions for the product to perform the proofing validation. The proofing process will return any errors found in the validation process (updated in PRODUCT.ERRORS field) and these must be fixed before the product can be published.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    2. CANCEL.PROOF :</p>
            <p />
            <p>    After a successful/partially sucessfull proffing process, if the user wishes to cancel the proofing process i.e. delete the PRF records which may have been updated, he may choose this option which would bring the product back to the stage before proofing process was attempted.</p>
            <p />
            <p>    3. PUBLISH :</p>
            <p />
            <p>    After the product has been successfully proofed, then the next step is to update this product to catalog and make it available for sale to the customers. The process of moving files from PROOF to CATALOG is achieved by this option. When there are proofing errors, the product cannot be published. Also the status of the product in AA.PRODUCT file should be 'PROOFED' to attempt this option. The rules which govern the proofing process(with respect to hierarchy) apply to publishing as well.</p>
