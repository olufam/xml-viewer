            <desc>
                <p>This field indicates the ownership percentage of the customer in the arrangement with respect to tax liability.  Based on the percentage defined for each customer, income will be split and tax will be calculated using the respective tax percentage of each customer and the income split.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Customer 1 – 50%</p>
                <p>Customer 2 – 50%</p>
                <p>Interest capitalization amount: $1000.</p>
                <p>Tax percentage for Customer 1 is 10% and for Customer 2 is 0% (since the customer is minor).</p>
                <p>Now the Tax will be calculated by applying 10% on $500 and 0% on $500. So the net tax amount will $50 for which tax accounting will be raised.</p>
