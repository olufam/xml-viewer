Based on the percentage defined for each customer, income will be split and tax will be calculated using the respective tax percentage of each customer and the income split.</p>
                <p/>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Customer 1 – 50%</p>
                <p>Customer 2 – 50%</p>
                <p>Interest capitalization amount: $1000.</p>
                <p>Tax percentage for Customer 1 is 10% and for Customer 2 is 0% (since the customer is minor).</p>
                <p>Now the Tax will be calculated by applying 10% on $500 and 0% on $500. So the net tax amount will $50 for which tax accounting will be raised.</p>
